<p class="ph3">DUKE JOHANN&rsquo;S CHAPEL</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Von Orsova</span> is playing a dangerous game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He takes the risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; It was I who asked the question,
curious to hear what penalty attached to the handsome
Rittmeister&rsquo;s temerity.</p>

<p>The three men gave glances at each other, as
though inquiring which of them could answer. My
friend Von Lindheim broke the pause, replying with a
shrug&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a Captain of Cavalry, Master of the Horse;
a gentleman, noble, no doubt, by birth, but a simple,
if magnificent, Rittmeister. The lady&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced
round towards the dark shadows of the trees, gave
another shrug of caution and lowered his voice,&mdash;&ldquo;is
what we all know. To couple their names is
high treason; and, <i>a fortiori</i>, it is treason in a higher
degree for the Bursche to aspire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not forgotten,&rdquo; another said, &ldquo;the
case of poor Steiner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw they were not inclined to run risks by discussing
State secrets under the very walls of the
palace, so postponed the gratification of my curiosity
until I should get Von Lindheim alone in my rooms
or his house. We four had slipped out into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>gardens, to snatch ten minutes for a cigarette from
the rather dreary formality of a State ball at the palace
of Buyda. My three companions were guests in
their official capacities, being attached to the bureau
of the world-known Chancellor Rallenstein; I,
Jasper Tyrrell, a mere traveller, through the friendly
offices of Von Lindheim, to whom I had an introduction.
I had gone abroad in a restless, roving
frame of mind, ready for any adventure, and heartily
sick of the monotony of inaction, forced inaction,
very slightly relieved by the problematical fun of
entertaining big shooting parties at my place in
Norfolk. That seemed all I had to look forward
to in the year, and the more I thought of my autumn
programme the more restless and discontented had I
grown. Even the temporary diversion of marriage,
strenuously commended to me by certain not altogether
disinterested friends, had failed to take hold
on my fancy; amusements of that sort can be
arranged at any time and at comparatively short
notice. So one night at dinner, during which several
friends and relations were good enough to map out a
very pretty six months&rsquo; programme for me&mdash;and
themselves&mdash;my resolution was taken, and before I
had got into bed that night my kit for an extended
solitary ramble was packed. Next day I made a bolt
of it, leaving to an astute aunt full authority, by
letter, to carry on Sharnston in my absence, and after
a month&rsquo;s desultory progress found myself at Buyda.</p>

<p>A generation ago there were, as every student of
European diplomacy knows, some very curious
political intrigues (we know more about them now)
in several of the Courts of Europe. More or less
secret acts of aggressive statesmanship were perpetrated
which, had they not been diplomatically
covered up or explained away, would have seemed
to set the forces of civilization to right-about-face.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>But the press, like speech, often serves, in some countries
at any rate, to withhold rather than to give out
information, while special correspondents are mostly
acclimatized and often merely human.</p>

<p>Still, there was somewhere, in east central Europe
for choice, a chance of seeing something of life a little
more adventurous than the cricket field or the covert
at home had to offer, and with young blood in one&rsquo;s
veins, a perfect digestion, a muscular system second
to none at Angelo&rsquo;s, the idea of a possible running
into adventures is not displeasing. The dull smoothness
and security of a well-policed community is
monotonous to a man of spirit.</p>

<p>Such were the vague anticipations with which I
set forth, but my imagination certainly never suggested
such a series of adventures as that which I was
to pass through before I got back.</p>

<p>I had purposely left my destination uncertain, even
to my own mind. In the true spirit of adventure I
would be bound by no fixed route, but let my fancy
and the circumstances of the moment carry me
whither they would. Only one indication of any sort
of purpose did I take with me. That was a letter
of introduction from an F. O. friend to an old school-fellow
of his, Gustav von Lindheim, a rich young
fellow who had been educated in England, and who
now held a post in the Chancellory of his native State.
It was in that corner of Europe that something of an
adventure seemed most likely to be had, and it was
there, to pass over my earlier wanderings, that I
eventually found myself.</p>

<p>Through the half-open windows of the great ball-room
came &ldquo;Amorettentänze,&rdquo; thundered out with
military swing and insistence by the resplendent
Court band. In company with my three acquaintances
I had strolled away from the illuminated portion
of the gardens, and we were now pacing a dark
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>and comparatively secluded walk. Encouraged perhaps
by the lessened probability of eavesdropping
(for methods under Rallenstein, the dread Chancellor&rsquo;s
rule, were mediæval, more or less), one of my
companions remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Princess looks bewitchingly pretty to-night.
The bold Rittmeister has indeed an excuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she also,&rdquo; Von Lindheim replied. &ldquo;The
fellow is the most splendid clothes-peg and wig-block
combined that I know. He is magnificent, the sort of
magnificence that does not live to see its grandchildren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a fool,&rdquo; one of the others said, &ldquo;to snap
his fingers so close to the Jaguar&rsquo;s snout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orsova is a fool, my dear Szalay,&rdquo; Von Lindheim
assented, &ldquo;as I have just hinted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Jaguar is couched and ready to spring
at the right moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our dear chief does not make a mistake or let
another man make it against his policy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! He has a plan, and the Herr Rittmeister
von Orsova forms no part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use for him. Prince Theodor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began
incautiously, when I was stopped by a subdued
chorus of &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secrets of State, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Von Lindheim
said, laughing, but with a warning gesture. &ldquo;You will
get us into trouble. You Englishmen, with your excess
of freedom, can&rsquo;t realize how circumspect we
have to be. You have no Jaguar ever ready for the
spring. You don&rsquo;t know our famous Red Chancellor&mdash;even
by reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strolling and talking thus, we had passed through
the gardens and struck into a path, skirting a little
wood beyond the pleasaunce of the royal grounds.
My companions stopped and turned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just finish my cigar and follow you,&rdquo; I said.
The Emperadore was too good to throw away for the
sake of hurrying back to an entertainment of which,
to tell the truth, the petty splendour rather bored me.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we all turned back together. Suddenly
Szalay halted, and pointed into the wood.
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all looked. A light was glimmering from the
depth of the blackness; a light suggested rather than
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Duke Johann&rsquo;s old chapel there, now
used as a summer-house,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but what can any one be doing there at
this time of night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to investigate,&rdquo; the third man, D&rsquo;Urban,
said with official zeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, then. We can get round this way again
to the terrace, and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had plunged into the wood, making for the
light. I followed them a step or two, then stopped
and regained the path, not seeing how the question
of the irregular illumination could interest me. Enjoying
my cigar I strolled on. The night was pleasant
enough. A slight warm breeze drove the clouds
slowly across a gibbous moon, giving a pretty play of
light and shade. So I sauntered on in a frame of
mind attuned to my present surroundings. I had
become so far acclimatized as to take an interest in
the Court intrigues which flourished in the air of that
Chancellor-ruled kingdom. I had an idea of seeking
a temporary commission in the State cavalry, that
dazzling regiment with its picture-book cattle and its
theatrical accoutrements. I was only awaiting to see
whether there was any grit inside all that fur and
brass and steel and bullion, not caring to ear-mark
myself with a regiment of costumiers&rsquo; dummies.
This doubt made me take a peculiar interest in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>magnificent spectacular warrior, the Rittmeister von
Orsova. Granted he was a fool, he might be a plucky
fool. That the pretty Princess Casilde (and she was
lovely) was in love with him, or something near it,
was common gossip in the inner circle of Court officialdom.
But the despotic Chancellor held other views
and plans. Having made himself the foremost man
in the State (for the King, with all his parade of
authority, was notoriously under his thumb), he now
nursed the one idea of the State&rsquo;s aggrandizement as
the only way left of increasing his own power. And it
was evident that that aggrandizement could best be
attained by allying his master&rsquo;s house with the richer
and more important state of which Prince Theodor
was heir-apparent. Hence the projected marriage
between that Prince and the Princess Casilde. Such
was the state of affairs when I found myself in Buyda.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FACE IN THE LIGHT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a while I turned in my walk. It was time to
get back to the ball-room if I would not appear to
slight the honour shown me in the invitation. I had
rather lost my bearings in the wooded walk, and in
returning had the choice of three paths without knowing
which one to take. I chose that which seemed
to lead directly towards the distant music, and
walked on quickly. It soon appeared that it was not
the path I had come by. It led me much deeper into
the wood than I had been before; still, the music
seemed to grow nearer, and I flattered myself it might
be a short cut. Hurrying on, I suddenly came upon
a clearing in the wood. In the middle of this stood a
small building&mdash;Duke Johann&rsquo;s chapel, of which my
companions had spoken. A quaint little edifice built,
so far as the fitful light showed me, in a highly ornate
style of Moorish architecture.</p>

<p>It was still lighted up dimly; a ray fell across the
path at some little distance in front of me, evidently
from one of the side windows. Neither the place,
although it was romantic enough, nor the light
particularly interested me. But as I went round
towards the opposite side of the clearing, I was
arrested by a curious sight.</p>

<p>The stream of light which I have spoken of became
suddenly interrupted, then diffused and broken up,
then it swept from side to side. I stopped and watched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>it for a few seconds, then my eye followed the movement
to its cause.</p>

<p>Just outside the window, half blocking the light
and dispersing it, was a man&rsquo;s head. The body I
could not see, as it was naturally in the deep shadow.
But the face! It was peering into the chapel eagerly,
its expression, illuminated into strong relief by the
light which streamed upon it from the little window,
was one I can hardly describe, but shall never forget.
Perhaps I can best give an idea of it by likening it to
the look of hungry ferocious expectation in the eyes
of a tiger which has got to within striking distance of
its quarry. The sight was so extraordinary that I
must have stood for several seconds hardly drawing
my breath, and looking at it half fascinated.
Then something told me it would be better to walk
on, taking no further notice. After all, I had a perfect
right as a guest to be in the wood, and&mdash;&mdash;. In the
dark shadow of a buttress near the window there
was a quick movement, but quite independent of the
peering man. Next instant a form crossed the band of
light; another man had come out of the darkness and
accosted me.</p>

<p>His first words were rough and brusque. &ldquo;What
are you doing here?&rdquo; Then, noticing his mistake,
and concluding probably by my appearance that I
was a gentleman, and one of the royal guests, he
abruptly changed his tone and manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon! You are waiting here for some one,
mein Herr, or wish to return to the palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was taking the liberty of smoking a cigar,&rdquo; I
answered, as politely as I felt inclined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here? In the wood?&rdquo; The question was put
sharply, with a certain stern incredulity and insistence
strangely at variance with the man&rsquo;s look. I
scarcely knew whether to resent or laugh at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till this minute,&rdquo; I replied, deeming it easiest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>to be straightforward in that land of ceremonies and
red tape. &ldquo;I have been smoking outside the wood,
and took this path back to the palace. Why? Is it
forbidden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man gave a shrug, but never relaxed his fixed
gaze on my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under certain circumstances. You have not
been to this spot till this moment, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not here just now; three, four minutes
ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not used to have my word doubted, sir,&rdquo;
I returned, getting a little out of patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon.&rdquo; He changed his tone again, reverting
to its first bluffness. &ldquo;You are English. I may
ask your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him, adding, &ldquo;I presume you have a right to
ask it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; he said again, but his manner was still
offensive. &ldquo;You have been here alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I have been smoking with three friends
who hold official positions here. They have gone in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke in English now&mdash;&ldquo;we
are obliged to be circumspect here; you in England
may not comprehend our necessity. Excuse me if I
ask a few questions, in no spirit of idle curiosity, I
assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those gentlemen, your friends they left you here
in the wood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the path outside it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not been in this wood before now to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen your friends since you parted
from them down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No? Why did you walk this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; I answered, getting somewhat exasperated,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should submit to this
cross-examination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, showing a set of cruel teeth. &ldquo;Because
you are an Englishman it is incomprehensible. May
one inquire without offence your object in walking
this way when the path to the palace is outside the
wood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you must know, I took this path by mistake.
I trust I have not transgressed any rule of your
Court etiquette&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;You say you did
not speak with your friends again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Is there any offence in that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put the question in a bantering tone, and was
rather surprised that he took it seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell. All depends on the subject
of conversation. Let me see, Herren Szalay, Von
Lindheim, and D&rsquo;Urban; not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Is there anything more you wish to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At present, nothing. I thank you. Let me offer
you my apologies and a piece of advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful of your words. You are not in England
here. Our master, the Herr Chancellor, has no&mdash;patience
with chatterers. Good-night. That is
your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph3">THE JAGUAR</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> all an Englishman&rsquo;s wonder and impatience at so
intolerable a system of surveillance, I made my way
back to the palace.</p>

<p>The dance was in full swing again. In the crowd
I could not for the moment see any one of my three
friends. The King was on a daïs chatting in animated
fashion to a group standing round him. His daughter,
the Princess Casilde, presently came out of the
throng of dancers, and sat beside him, joining laughingly
in the conversation. I saw the great cavalry
swell, the Master of the Horse, Von Orsova, waltzing
with a plain-looking girl, and was just wondering
what sort of a soldier&rsquo;s heart beat beneath that glorious
tunic, when Von Lindheim came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lindheim,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a queer thing happened
after you fellows left me just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, looking grave,
though he tried to smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was passing through the wood by the chapel
when a fellow accosted me, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped me. &ldquo;Hush, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake.
Here! Come in here and tell me. How do you like
the new decoration?&rdquo; he went on in a louder tone,
with a wave of the hand towards the ceiling and walls;
&ldquo;this is only the second time the Saal has been used
since the scaffolding came down. It was closed all
the spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>His extraordinary change of tone and subject led
me for a moment to wonder whether he had not been
paying too assiduous court to the Royal champagne:
then I concluded that it was a blind. Talking on
commonplace subjects, we sauntered across the adjoining
music-saal, thence to a deserted room, one of
the great suite of state apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, lowering his voice and speaking
anxiously, &ldquo;tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him. His face grew graver and whiter every
moment. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is it
officialism gone mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I cannot tell
you. Only for your life, for the lives of all of us,
don&rsquo;t breathe a word of it&mdash;not even to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him inquisitively, and indeed my
curiosity was greater than my concern. &ldquo;Is there
any danger,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;in my inquiring the name
of the fellow who honoured me with the cross-examination?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do for Heaven&rsquo;s sake dismiss the whole affair,&rdquo;
Von Lindheim answered impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think
we have done anything wrong,&rdquo; he added quickly;
&ldquo;it is less and yet worse than that. Our only chance
is that we were not recognized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had been, of course, and it was on the tip of
my tongue to say so, but I checked myself, thinking I
would not add to his uneasiness, unreasonable as it
seemed. There I made a great mistake, as the story
will show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better get back to the ball-room,&rdquo; my
friend said nervously. &ldquo;Do you know there are
said to be twenty thousand separate pieces in that
great chandelier? It is one of the most elaborate
specimens of glass work in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My inspection of this interesting piece of work was
cut short by Von Lindheim&rsquo;s directing my attention,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>in an equally abrupt manner, to a specimen of
Nature&rsquo;s handicraft far more engaging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me introduce you to Fräulein
Asta von Winterstein. She is one of the Maids of
Honour, and the most charming girl in Buyda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fräulein&rsquo;s looks decidedly confirmed his words;
a merry-looking girl, with a lovely face, and that air
of youth and spirits which is so eloquent of the <i>joie de
vivre</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are fortunate in getting a dance with Fräulein
von Winterstein,&rdquo; Lindheim said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only just off duty,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;and my
card is a blank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was beginning a complimentary remark when my
friend said, &ldquo;Excuse my depriving you of five seconds
of the Fräulein&rsquo;s society, my dear Tyrrell, but I
have a message to give her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drew aside and I waited. Happening to
glance at them I noticed that a cloud had come over
the girl&rsquo;s face; both looked grave as they spoke in
an undertone, then the girl&rsquo;s natural animation
returned, and with a few laughing words to Von
Lindheim, she left him and came to me. A swinging
waltz was being played and we took several turns.
When we stopped I remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our friend, Von Lindheim, seems worried about
something, I&rsquo;m afraid he takes officialism too seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Englishman cannot understand the peculiarities
of our life here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was rather tired of being told that, albeit rather
glad of my ignorance. Still, I did not mind the adage
from this girl; she was breezy and sensible, and
determined not to be too insular with respect to
Buyda officialism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you admire the Princess?&rdquo; my partner
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one thinks her lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not the only belle in the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&mdash;Luckily; for she is out of reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally. Herr Rittmeister von Orsova is a
fine specimen of a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the genius of indiscretion. A splendid
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he is all through alike, and that the grit
and pluck correspond to the spectacular part of the
show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t for a moment. Only Nature does sometimes
send out inferior goods in smart cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is as brave as he is handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Oh, by&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had stopped in the waltz, with the result that the
next couple cannoned against us severely. The reason
of my sudden pull-up was something which in the
whirl had passed my eye.</p>

<p>Bending over the daïs in close conversation with
the King was a man whom I had not observed there
before. And that man&rsquo;s was the face I had seen peering
into the chapel window. The expression was
altered now, but the face was the same, one never to
be mistaken or forgotten, a face curiously striking in its
suggestion of immense power and indomitable will,
yet ugly almost to repulsiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; I asked eagerly. &ldquo;That man
talking to the King?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked at me curiously. &ldquo;Surely you
know him, at least by sight. No? Why, that is
our great Chancellor, Graf von Rallenstein.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE KING AND THE CHANCELLOR</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I began</span> to understand Von Lindheim&rsquo;s disquietude;
all the same, although the Chancellor&rsquo;s system of
espionage was pretty notorious, I did not quite see
what my friend had to be so afraid of. True, I was
an Englishman, and we know the aphorism; then he,
too, was half English and a Rugby boy. Still, I
suppose he counted as a native under the heel of the
man known throughout Europe as the Red Chancellor,
the man who never stood any nonsense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Von Rallenstein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you really never saw him before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never before to-night; not even his photograph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not extraordinary,&rdquo; she replied in a low
voice. &ldquo;He has never allowed himself to be photographed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to speculate how this great statesman came
to be in that undignified position outside the chapel
window, and to marvel at the customs of the land in
which I found myself. Then I recollected that my
partner expected me to dance, not muse, and we
whirled on.</p>

<p>The waltz came to an end. As we stopped I felt
myself touched on the shoulder. A man, evidently
one of the officers of the household, was at my side.
He addressed me by name. &ldquo;His Majesty desires to
make your better acquaintance when the honoured
Fräulein can spare you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was of course a command, so I took my partner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>to a seat and made for the daïs. The King and the
Chancellor were still chatting confidentially as I
approached. The former received me very graciously,
and presented me to Von Rallenstein, who shook
hands in a manner which was almost British. The
conversation at once glided into a perfectly easy
groove; the King was very affable, and courteously
interested himself in my movements, asked me how I
liked the country and city, how long I thought of staying,
what part of England I lived in, was pleased to
hear I had come over for sport; asked me several
questions on horse-breeding, and said, as the subject
was one in which he took peculiar interest, he should
esteem it a great advantage to have the benefit of my
advice and experience, and would go more fully into
it at an early opportunity. All this was very pleasant;
Von Rallenstein chimed in now and again with a
pertinent remark or leading suggestion; he seemed
agreeable enough, and I began to think Von Lindheim&rsquo;s
bugbear was principally of his own making.
Of course any one could see that the Chancellor was a
strong man and a masterful, but, after all, he had a
peculiar country to govern, and those were the qualities
necessary to that end. Had I never seen that cruel,
almost fiendish face at the window, I should have
thought its owner a very good fellow&mdash;for his place.
In this world of weaklings one does not admire a
man less for his grit and power.</p>

<p>Presently the talk halted; and I understood from
the King&rsquo;s manner that the interview was to close.
He dismissed me very graciously, hoping I should
enjoy myself both that evening and during the whole
of my stay in his country. Von Rallenstein added
a word or two, and I bowed myself off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find the King, and, more particularly,
the Chancellor?&rdquo; Fräulein von Winterstein
inquired when I rejoined her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very alarming. But then I am&mdash;an&mdash;&lsquo;outsider.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A gorgeous being came up whose twinkling eyes
were in ludicrous contrast to his fiercely brushed-up
moustache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, here is Herr Oberkammerer Eilhardt,&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl, introducing us. &ldquo;Herr Oberkammerer,
our friend Mr. Tyrrell wishes to be acquainted
with Herr Rittmeister von Orsova, whom I know to
be a great friend of yours. Mr. Tyrrell is interested
in the First Regiment of Cuirassiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Herr Oberkammerer bowed with an energy
begotten of Court life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would charm me to be the medium of bringing
our much-honoured guest into friendship with the
Herr Rittmeister. My friend Von Orsova of a
certainty comes to my rooms here to conclude the
evening and drink a glass of wine. If Herr Tyrrell
would honour me likewise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked him and accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be capital,&rdquo; my partner said. &ldquo;You
can discuss arms and horses, and enflame your martial
spirits over some of the Royal Steinberger Cabinet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can answer for the quality of the wine,&rdquo; Eilhardt
returned. &ldquo;The dance is nearly at an end;
we keep early hours in Buyda. I cannot leave until
his Majesty retires. But if you will meet me here
ten minutes after the King&rsquo;s departure, I shall do
myself the honour to conduct you to my apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I agreed, and with a flourish he left us, swaggering
off towards the royal party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just as well to have a quiet chat with Von
Orsova,&rdquo; Fräulein von Winterstein observed. &ldquo;He
is too fond of the dance to say many words to one
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien entendu.</i> He is a perfect waltzer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy partners!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; her manner made me ask. Then I
followed her eyes and saw the reason of her whispered
caution. The tall Rittmeister was waltzing with
the Princess. They passed quite close to us. He was
talking to her with an earnestness far beyond the
usual ball-room trifling, or even flirtation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A serious affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrell, you are hopelessly indiscreet. Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the band stopped. The King had risen
abruptly and was evidently about to retire. The
musicians stood up and played the National Hymn.
The Princess Casilde went quickly to her father, a
procession was formed, and having interchanged
bows with the company the royal party retired.</p>

<p>There was to be a dance or two more; and, as
though relieved by the departure of royalty, every one
seemed to become more animated, smiles were
now laughter, and the excessive, almost oppressive
decorum of the dance vanished.</p>

<p>My partner had hurried away with a bewitching
&ldquo;<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>&rdquo; to join the royal party. Left
alone, I betook myself to the corner of the ball-room
where Herr Eilhardt was to find me.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE DESERTED BALL-ROOM</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> this State ball did not degenerate exactly into
a romp, it grew more free and easy as I sat watching
it and waiting for the Oberkammerer. Von Orsova
seemed to have had enough of dancing&mdash;he was
evidently a good deal run after&mdash;and was now parading
about with a dashing, middle-aged woman,
corresponding to the skittish colonels&rsquo; wives we see
in our garrison towns. They passed me, she chattering
and laughing, he rather bored, as it struck me,
and strolled off towards the music-room. Then I
noticed the two men, Szalay and D&rsquo;Urban, who
had been with Von Lindheim and me in the gardens.
They were talking earnestly together. I wondered
if they, too, took the same serious view of the situation
as my friend.</p>

<p>Herr Eilhardt presently appeared and hurried
to me with profuse apologies for having kept me
waiting. The King was particularly exigeant that
night, he had most unwarrantably taken it into
his head to discuss certain arrangements, as though
any one could be expected to enter into such subjects
at midnight after a dance. This he confided to
me confidentially, and then proceeded to look round
for his other guest.</p>

<p>Von Orsova was not to be seen in the thinning
crowd. With renewed and quite unnecessary apologies
the Oberkammerer sailed off in search of him.
Only to return alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rittmeister is nowhere to be seen. He
has doubtless already gone to my apartment, not
knowing I should return here. Shall we ascend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We ascended. Herr Eilhardt occupied a comfortable
suite of rooms, shut off, like a flat, in a
distant block of the great rambling palace. He was
evidently a man of taste, from the quaint old furniture,
the pictures and curiosities, with which his
bachelor quarters were crammed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Herr Rittmeister is already here, yes?&rdquo;
he inquired of his servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Oberkammerer,&rdquo; the man answered, &ldquo;the
Herr Rittmeister has not yet arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My host led the way into one of the most delightful
dens I ever puffed smoke in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we make ourselves comfortable? Von
Orsova must be here directly. He said he should
come. Adolph! The wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a good time here,&rdquo; I remarked with
a glance at my surroundings, almost too gorgeous
for a bachelor official.</p>

<p>He laughed. He seemed to have thrown off his
official manner, to have become more human and
less of a marionette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in a groove,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and it is
necessary to make that groove as comfortable as
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; he proceeded with a frankness
which rather surprised me: &ldquo;in the artificial life
of a Court it is good to keep up the illusion. One
must take one&rsquo;s duties seriously; etiquette, forms
and ceremonies are often in themselves ridiculous.
If one allowed oneself to feel their absurdity one
could never perform them properly. One&rsquo;s surroundings
must be in keeping with one&rsquo;s life; it
would be fatal to regard them from an outsider&rsquo;s
point of view.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are rather a philosopher, mein Herr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a countryman of Heine. A philosopher I
hope first, and an official afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I congratulate you. How few of
us can say we accept our lot in the same spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. A servant in
quaint livery entered and made two prodigious bows
before delivering his message, which was to the effect
that the King desired the Oberkammerer&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I attend His Majesty immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man bowed twice again almost to the ground
and departed.</p>

<p>In a moment my host had resumed his professional
manner of a mediæval master of the ceremonies. His
apologies were unbounded. It was most unfortunate;
the King did not require his attendance at this hour
once in six months. That it should have happened on
this of all nights was deplorable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of duty,&rdquo; I said, holding out my
hand, &ldquo;no apology can be needed. I shall hope to
have the pleasure of paying you another visit and
of resuming our interesting conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not for how long his Majesty may require
my attendance,&rdquo; he said regretfully. &ldquo;His Majesty
has lately been given to step outside his prescribed
circle,&rdquo; which was one way of hinting at eccentricity.
&ldquo;And the Rittmeister von Orsova does not seem
likely to honour me to-night. It is altogether unfortunate,
but you will give me the pleasure of dining
here, and I will ask Von Orsova to meet you. You
will not stay now? I am horrified at the idea of
turning you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assured him that such violent emotion was unnecessary,
and we left his rooms together, retracing
our steps through the labyrinthine corridors and
stairways of the old palace, my companion keeping
up a string of explanations and apologies, which, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>course, I politely deprecated. I was disappointed
at missing Von Orsova, but he evidently was not
bound for the Oberkammerer&rsquo;s quarters that night.</p>

<p>Before a pair of emblazoned doors, guarded by a
sentry, my host stopped and bade me good-night.
&ldquo;I must leave you here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as my time, you
understand, is not my own. If you wait for a few
moments I will send a man to show you the way out
of the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite unnecessary,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Please
do not trouble. I have the bump of locality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grand entrance will be closed, or your way
would be simply down these stairs. As it is, your
nearest way will be to go to the end here, then along
the picture corridor on the right, pass through the last
door, thence you will easily find your way down to the
private entrance. The sentries will direct you.
Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a flourish he passed through the grand doors
into the royal apartments, and I went on through the
suite of anterooms. Beyond the last I found myself
in a long corridor, panelled with portraits from that
bygone world to which my late companion was so
tenaciously clinging. &ldquo;Go through the last door,&rdquo;
he had said. But there were two, exactly facing
each other, and as fate would have it I pushed through
the left-hand one instead of the right.</p>

<p>I saw at once that I had made a mistake. I was in
a curious room, something like a private box at the
theatre, but on a very large scale. What light there
was came through a half-closed window at the farther
end. It was all so peculiar that my curiosity made me
step forward and look through the window. A glance
explained it. The little apartment overlooked the
great ball-room where we had danced that evening,
now in darkness save for the rays of a brilliant moon
which streamed in full radiance through the row of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>windows on the opposite side, and for one other light.
A pair of candles in a massive silver holder were placed
on a console table, and showed me an extraordinary
scene. Two men standing in a recess by a window
facing one another, and one pointing a pistol at his
companion&rsquo;s breast. The light falling on the polished
barrel showed it clearly and made me certain of
that. But what astounded me most was my recognition
of the two; the man with the pistol was
the one who had accosted and questioned me in
the wood that evening; I knew him in an instant;
and the other was even less unmistakable&mdash;Von
Orsova.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth are they doing?&rdquo; I said to
myself. &ldquo;What fresh piece of tomfoolery is this?&rdquo;
For it looked childish enough; the two were so
quiet and matter-of-fact that it might have been
a rehearsal of a stage scene. After the Oberkammerer
and his playing at mediævalism I was prepared
for anything.</p>

<p>The men were talking, but in so low a tone that
from the distance I could not catch their words.
But the man still continued to cover Von Orsova&rsquo;s
heart with his pistol; they were not two paces apart.
I wondered how long they were going to keep up
the attitude, which was not particularly heroic or
effective from my point of view.</p>

<p>At last the murmur of their voices ceased; there
was a movement, and one which sent a thrill through
me. Not so much the action as the agonized look
on Von Orsova&rsquo;s face as he threw up his hands with a
gesture of despair, and, turning almost with a stagger
to the wall, leaned against it with his head on his arm.
The other never let the pistol drop&mdash;it was still pitilessly
pointed at the Rittmeister. Then I realized
that something serious was in progress. My idea
was that the smaller man was trying to extort something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>from Von Orsova, having got him at a disadvantage.
But I was wrong, at least in that my
speculation did not go far enough.</p>

<p>After a few seconds Von Orsova turned again,
facing the man and throwing out his hand in desperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke louder, and by pushing
the window a little way open I could hear him plainly
say now&mdash;&ldquo;is there no other way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reply came coldly and uncompromisingly.
&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is devilish, it is sheer murder,&rdquo; Von Orsova
exclaimed bitterly; &ldquo;and you, Count, you lend yourself
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most regretfully. But the State is before everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chancellor, you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, the State. Time is short, Herr Rittmeister.
It would be a pity if I should be forced to
pull the trigger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Von Orsova gave a great sigh. &ldquo;Let me
take the alternative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to the console table and took up from
it a small object which I could not distinguish. As
he did so the other moved with him the corresponding
distance, keeping the same space between them, and
ever covering him with the pistol. Then they returned
to their former positions. Von Orsova
seemed to be manipulating the thing he held in his
hand. &ldquo;My offence does not merit this punishment,&rdquo;
he said, almost coolly, so coolly that I began to
wonder what the punishment was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chancellor judges otherwise,&rdquo; the Count returned.
&ldquo;You played a dangerous game, Herr
Rittmeister, and must have known the risk you ran.
But my orders are not to talk but to act; you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Von Orsova raised the hand which held the small
object. &ldquo;This works quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instantaneously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldier seemed to fumble with it, then he burst
out, &ldquo;This is horrible! I cannot&mdash;I am young and
unready to die. Furello, my friend, let me escape;
no one need ever know. I have rich relations and
friends; I will buy my life with a fortune beyond&mdash;ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cry was one of despair, as the Count extended
his arm to fire, and so cut short the other&rsquo;s pleading.
It was appalling. As I realized what was going forward
I broke out into a cold perspiration. My nerves
are pretty firm, but I found myself trembling and
almost paralysed, at least quite unable to decide on
any line of action. The Count&rsquo;s reply fell on my ear,
but my brain was only half conscious of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you ten seconds. I am not a madman;
and, if I were, escape would be impossible. Shall I
fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Orsova raised his hand. &ldquo;I will spare you the
trouble,&rdquo; he said, and then turned to the wall. I
heard the murmuring sound of his voice, perhaps in
prayer; then he raised his right hand to his head.
Next moment he staggered from the wall and fell
heavily backwards with an awful thud, his head almost
striking the Count, who jumped back that it
might clear him. So he stood for a few seconds
watching the supine body, his pistol still pointing
as though fearing a trick. Then he moved round,
always keeping his face towards the body, took up
the candles in his disengaged hand, and held the
light so that it fell on Von Orsova&rsquo;s face. From the
distance at which I was placed I could plainly see
the features, livid and distorted. I realized then
that the startling tragedy was over. By a curious
reaction my nerves suddenly regained their normal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>tension, and I could view the scene with as little
excitement as though it were occurring on the stage,
could look in mere curiosity to see what the Count
would do next. It was dramatic enough. The great
room was dark now (for the moon was obscured),
save at one corner, where the candles flickered on the
ghastly face of the dead Hussar, made more horrible
by contrast with his gorgeous uniform; then the
relentless black figure stooping over him.</p>

<p>Satisfied apparently with his inspection, the Count
set the candelabrum on the floor, and kneeling down
beside the body, proceeded to unfasten the tunic,
and inserting his hand, kept it for a while upon the
heart. He withdrew it, fastened the gilt button
again, raised the dead hand and let it fall with a
thud on the floor. Then he rose and took up the light,
seemed to notice some small object lying near, which
he pushed with his foot towards the body, held the
lights above his head, and looked round the room.</p>

<p>Then he set down the candelabrum upon the table
again, and went softly to the door.</p>

<p>I groped my way back into the corridor, pushed
open the right door this time, and found my way
without difficulty down to the private entrance of the
palace. A soldier on guard there challenged me, but
saluted and made way respectfully on my explaining
that I had come from the Oberkammerer&rsquo;s apartments.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE CAPSIZED BOAT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning I could hardly persuade myself that
what I had seen the night before had not been all a
dream. In the bright sunshine and in the active
work-a-day life of the city, the ghastly business
seemed impossible. But the effect of my experience
lay heavy on my mind. I felt I could do nothing.
As a State affair it was no business of mine to interfere;
I could not decide even whether I should tell
Von Lindheim what I knew. I was to see him late
that afternoon, and had the greater part of the day
at my disposal. Thinking that exercise would be the
best means of shaking off my depression, I determined
to revert to an old sport of mine, rowing. Accordingly,
after a late breakfast, I hired the lightest sculling
boat I could find, and went for a pull up the river.
A picturesque stream, the Narvo, when once you get
clear of the wharves, mills, warehouses, and like unromantic
accessories; but the worst piece of water
for a steady pull that I had ever dipped oar into, and
I had tried a good many, from the Wensum to the
Danube. No sooner did I get into my swing and the
craft began to slip along, than I had to hold her up
for an eyot, or a patch of aggressive water lilies,
varied by what answers in those parts for a weir, or a
superfluous, if picturesque waterfall.</p>

<p>But the clearing of the obstacles was all in the
day&rsquo;s work. I was not bound against time for the
source of the river, so pushed, hauled, and punted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>energetically, thinking the change of working muscles
no bad thing. As a reward for my perseverance I
presently got away from all signs of the town; the
banks grew higher and, with their overhanging bushes,
something like our Wye, shut out the hideous chimneys
and other unromantic evidences of Buyda&rsquo;s commercial
prosperity. As I pulled leisurely up a comparatively
clear reach, my train of thought was
snapped by the bow of my boat striking against
some light object. I looked round and saw I had
run against a floating scull. I took it into my boat,
thinking some one might have let it slip and been
unable to recover it, an awkward mishap not uncommon
with duffers; then I rowed on, thinking to
come across the owner before long. The sound of
rushing water warned me that I was approaching another
of the weirs, of which just then I was getting
rather tired, since they meant haulage. Beyond a
sharpish bend the river widened considerably, the
current became stronger, and, looking ahead, I could
see an obstacle, half weir, half natural waterfall, with
the usual rotten posts and dilapidated rails. I pulled
on, undecided whether to take the trouble of carrying
my craft round or to return, when a stroke took me
beyond, and so in sight of an object lying caught in the
sedge outside the current.</p>

<p>A capsized boat.</p>

<p>I did not like the look of it. &ldquo;That accounts for
the scull,&rdquo; I said, and pulled round to examine her.
No one was to be seen on the banks, which were flat
and open here. I ran my boat alongside the overturned
craft. With some difficulty I righted her.
A row-boat, similar to mine, she was of course empty,
except that, jammed under the thwarts was a walking-stick,
an ordinary bamboo with a hook handle and
the usual silver band. This I threw into my boat,
and then got ashore. Not a soul was in sight. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>walked up a good way past the fall, giving an occasional
shout, but there was no sign of any human
being, dead or alive, and the one seemed now as much
to be looked for as the other.</p>

<p>So I returned to my boat without having got nearer
to the mystery, and now determined to pull homewards,
for the river up higher did not promise much
reward for my exertions. As I went back, however,
I looked sharply about for any further evidences of a
boating accident, but found none. It looked to me
very much as though the boat had gone over the
fall, and the walking-stick decidedly pointed to someone
having been in her. But I came to the conclusion
that even then if the fellow could swim and had kept
his head he would probably have got off, with an
extremely unpleasant ducking, as the fall was not
great, and the water below clear of obstacles and
fairly deep.</p>

<p>At the landing-stage I told my story, but the capsized
boat did not belong to the owner of mine, and
the subject consequently lacked interest for him.
There had been accidents over the falls, he told me;
but it was people&rsquo;s own fault and stupidity. One of his
men, however, thought he had seen a gentleman rowing
up earlier in the day, but did not recognize him, or
know where the boat had been hired. That was all;
so not seeing what more I could be expected to do, I
went back to the hotel, calling, however, at the police
office on my way to give information of what I had
found. The officer in charge phlegmatically assured
me that the matter should be looked into, and bowed
me out.</p>

<p>Having changed my clothes, I went on to Von
Lindheim&rsquo;s. He had not returned home, although it
was past his usual hour, but shortly after my arrival
he made his appearance. He seemed in better
spirits, and I was glad to notice that the cloud of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>previous evening had passed away. He had been detained
at the Chancellerie, he said, by extra work;
D&rsquo;Urban was away, whether on leave or through illness
he had not been able to find out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was rather hard on me,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said,
&ldquo;but I had to stay over a stupid protocol, although I
told Krause, our chief, that I was taking an English
friend to the theatre. However, we have just time
for a short dinner, and the coffee we can get between
the acts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were going together <i>en garçon</i> to see Harff in
Shylock, and accordingly sat down to a hurried meal.</p>

<p>It had been in progress scarcely ten minutes when
word came in that Von Lindheim&rsquo;s friend and colleague,
Szalay, was waiting to see him on most urgent
business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told the Herr you were engaged, sir,&rdquo; said
the servant, &ldquo;but he said he must see you without
delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friend looked grave, and jumping up with a
word of apology to me, hurried from the room. I
concluded that the visit had to do with the discovery
of Von Orsova&rsquo;s death, and began to turn over in my
mind whether I ought to say what I knew. But
after all, I argued, it has nothing to do with these men;
I had better perhaps ignore a matter of which I have
no right to be cognizant. In a few minutes Von
Lindheim returned, followed by his visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a man of the world, my dear Tyrrell, and
we have come to put a case before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Szalay here has called to see me on a very serious
matter indeed. He has been challenged to fight a
duel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I whistled. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ridiculous little ass in the Royal Guard here;
a fellow who is always swaggering about full of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>own importance, a certain Captain Rassler de Hayn,
or Hahn, as he is nicknamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the cause of the quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Szalay broke in eagerly: &ldquo;None that I can tell of.
He sends a friend to me to say that I have spoken
disrespectfully of him, and so insulted his uniform, his
corps, the army, and the King. He will hear of no
apology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire-eating little fool!&rdquo; Von Lindheim ejaculated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps you have insulted him, and all the
rest of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not particularly. Everybody laughs at the little
spit-fire, you understand; I have laughed with the
rest. But not to his face; I have manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Hayn is a dead shot and a clever swordsman,&rdquo;
Von Lindheim observed grimly. &ldquo;These fools are
not wanting in pluck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why has he challenged me of all men?&rdquo;
Szalay cried, with a gesture of bewilderment.</p>

<p>Lindheim gave a shrug. &ldquo;Who can account for the
action of a conceited fathead? Szalay has come to
ask me to act for him. Of course, the whole affair is
ridiculous, still it may end seriously if we treat it as
lightly as it deserves. I must go and see this Lieutenant
Paulssen without delay. What line would
you take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come to the worst man in the world when
you put such a case to an Englishman,&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. You have no duels, and hold them supremely
absurd. But as a man of the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that, even in a complimentary
sense,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;But so far as my advice goes,
it would be to see this Lieutenant Paulssen, assure
him that your principal has no recollection of having
spoken disrespectfully of his, far less of any intention
to do so; that his man has been misinformed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>generally to apologize for any careless word by which
he may have unwittingly reflected upon that constructive
list of institutions he is so jealous of.
That&rsquo;s one way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, are you good with the sword or pistol?
I presume you, as the challenged, will have choice of
weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Tyrrell, fighting is out of the question.
One man is a professional cut-throat; Szalay is a
diplomat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not handled a sword since I left the university,&rdquo;
his friend added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally you don&rsquo;t want to fight, no sane man
does, especially over such imbecility. Though, of
course, if you could hit this little bouncer it would be
doing society a good service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go and see Paulssen at his quarters within
the next hour,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said, &ldquo;and you
shall know the result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Szalay went off, in no very easy frame of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst of this business is,&rdquo; my host remarked
when we were alone, &ldquo;that this Paulssen is himself a
hot-headed young fool. He probably will not want
this affair stopped, if he calculates on an opportunity
for showing off. I must tell him he is only likely to
make an exhibition of himself. Now, I&rsquo;m sorry to
hurry you. We may as well start together, and I
will join you after the first act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On our way I found that the news I had been all
day expecting had burst upon the city. Newsvendors
were crying the &ldquo;terrible suicide of Herr Rittmeister
von Orsova.&rdquo; The sudden announcement came as a
shock to Von Lindheim, yet it did not seem to strike
him as in any way unaccountable. I could see that
he, like myself, knew more of the affair than he
cared to tell. We bought a paper, and read it eagerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>in the street. Von Orsova had been found by a
servant early that morning lying dead in a corner of
the great ball-room of the palace. By his side was an
empty phial containing hydrocyanic acid; the unfortunate
Rittmeister had evidently taken his own
life, but the reason for the act was, up to that time,
enveloped in mystery.</p>

<p>My companion looked very grave as he folded up
the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; he remarked simply, adding
in a lower tone, &ldquo;the game he was playing could
scarcely end otherwise. Well, I must leave you here,
and see this fellow. I will be at the theatre as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the middle of the second act he dropped
quietly into the seat beside me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What success?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;None. I fear Szalay must
fight, and if he does&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He gave an expressive
shrug.</p>

<p>When the act was over we strolled out for coffee
and a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Hayn means to fight,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said in
answer to my inquiry. &ldquo;Paulssen was instructed not
to entertain any suggestion of an apology or explanation.
Szalay is a dead man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we have the affair stopped?&rdquo; I suggested.
&ldquo;Surely it is not countenanced by the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but winked at, and, in the army, permitted
under certain circumstances. There is only one
chance that I see. The Chancellor is against duelling;
he thinks it retrograde, and he is all for progress.
If I could contrive that he had wind of it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smart young fellow had come up to us and clapped
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Von Lindheim, the Baroness Fornbach
has sent me to tell you that she has been trying for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>last half-hour to catch your eye. But you are full of
secrets this evening. You are to come to her box
without fail, and disclose them to her. No; seriously,
she wants to see you. Of course bring your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Lindheim introduced us, and we three went off
to the Baroness&rsquo;s box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, old fellow; but I can&rsquo;t
throw a chance away to-night. The Baroness is good
style and great fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we entered the box we found it occupied by
two people. A man was in animated conversation
with the Baroness. He had his back turned to me,
and seemed to be finishing a good story, for they
were both laughing as the man rose and made way
for us. Von Lindheim presented me to the Baroness,
a good-looking widow, still young, and evidently a
woman of fashion. We shook hands, and she said a
few graceful words to me, then, with a slight gesture,
introduced me casually to her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count, you know Herr von Lindheim? Mr.
Tyrrell, Count Furello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning to bow, I found myself face to face with
the man who had accosted me by Duke Johann&rsquo;s
chapel the night before, the man who had forced
Von Orsova to his death. I knew him at once, despite
the fact that both my former views of him had been
imperfect; the feline eyes that glittered from the
dark recess of the box were unmistakable. And a
curious-looking man he was; a man whom at first
sight and without my previous knowledge of him, one
would hardly have known whether to set down as
attractive or detestable, but certainly interesting.</p>

<p>He had a mass of straight chestnut hair brushed
back from a high narrow forehead and falling in a
thick even wall over the back of his head. His eyes
were dark and alert, set a trifle too close together, his
nose was long and thin, and his mouth drawn back by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>what seemed an habitual muscular contraction into
a set grin, making a straight slit across his face in no
way hidden by the small reddish moustache which
was turned upwards well away from it. No doubt
he, too, recognized me; however, he gave no sign of it,
only made me a courtly bow with a few murmured
words of compliment. I turned again as the Baroness
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it out of compliment to Mr. Tyrrell&rsquo;s nationality
that you have been too much absorbed in Shakespeare
to notice your friends in the house, Herr von Lindheim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a&mdash;to me&mdash;obvious effort to throw off his
worry, as he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; I cannot claim such ultra politeness.
Harff is at his very best to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are giving yourself a poor character as a
diplomatist, Herr von Lindheim,&rdquo; said Count Furello,
&ldquo;in confessing that even the excitement of superb
acting can blind you to the realities of life around you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this very genially, almost banteringly, but
the man&rsquo;s good-humoured tone and laugh were obviously
a mask; behind his easy manner and glib
talk there was the suggestion of a sinister purpose;
it was a personality which in any case would have

<p class="ph3">SUPPER AT THE BARONESS&rsquo;S</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Baroness asked us to supper at her house after
the play, and would take no refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not stand out,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said afterwards,
&ldquo;as it will be a good opportunity of giving
the Count a hint about this wretched duel. He is a
sort of confidential aide of the Chancellor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite as easy-going as he looks,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Furello is not exactly a man to trifle with.
He would be the last man for Rallenstein&rsquo;s purpose if
he were. But I have always got on very well with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some other men came into the box and we left;
the Baroness making us renew our promise to sup
with her. &ldquo;I shall slip out after the Trial Scene,&rdquo;
Von Lindheim said, as we returned to our stalls, &ldquo;and
report progress to Szalay. Poor fellow! I expect
he is having an uncomfortable time. But I have
hope yet of stopping this absurd affair. If I cannot
get back here by the end of the play, we will meet at
the Baroness&rsquo;s, Wiener Platz, No. 1, the large house
at the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We met there later on, for he did not return to the
theatre.</p>

<p>There were about a dozen of us at supper, a merry
party enough when the champagne had gone round
once or twice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What an awful thing this is about poor Von
Orsova,&rdquo; some one remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor man!&rdquo; the hostess said, &ldquo;I dare not
think of it. It is too horrible; to think that I was
waltzing with him an hour before. To be dancing with
an already half dead man,&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a little affected
shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was to have been one of your guests to-night,
was he not?&rdquo; Furello asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. Who could have suspected when
he accepted my invitation that he knew he would be
dead long before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does any one know the reason he had for suicide?&rdquo;
a lady next him asked Furello.</p>

<p>The Count gave a shrug. &ldquo;Nothing has yet
transpired. But the motives for such an act are
often impossible to ascertain. There is nothing so
irresponsible and eccentric as the mind of a man who
has a tendency to self-murder. A sudden impulse is
enough to bring about the catastrophe. Who knows?
I for one should be very sorry to insist on an adequate
motive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at the man and wondered at his coolness.
He spoke easily, without a trace of effort to suppress
the truth. It was hard to recognize the grim executioner
in the glib, urbane society man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let us change the subject!&rdquo;
the Baroness cried. &ldquo;Life is quite miserable enough
without dwelling on these horrors. The poor man
is dead; what does it matter now? It is all shockingly
sad; but what can we do? After all, life is for
the living. Do all of you fill your glasses, and banish
melancholy for an hour at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Baroness,&rdquo; I said, for, as a foreigner, I
occupied the place of honour, &ldquo;you do not expect so
soon a return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of wretchedness? My dear Mr. Tyrrell, it is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>trite saying, but if we could only see inside each other&rsquo;s
hearts what a revelation some of them would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When supper was over, the ladies rose, and we
were invited to smoke in an adjoining room. Now
an infamous thing happened, which, by the greatest
good luck, I chanced to see. When the ladies were
gone, Von Lindheim went over and began to talk to
Count Furello, with the object, as I was sure, of
giving him a hint about poor Szalay&rsquo;s duel. I, of
course, kept aloof, and was happy in finding myself
next to a talkative young fellow, who had seen something
of English life, and was very interested in our
ideas of sport. We chatted away on this congenial
topic, and I took no further notice of my friend. My
young neighbour and I got on so well, that presently
he insisted that we should drink a bumper of champagne
together to our better acquaintance. Accordingly
we rose and went towards a sideboard at one
end of the smoking-room, where the wine and glasses
stood in array. Von Lindheim and Count Furello
were standing by talking quietly. In order not to
interrupt them, we kept a certain distance away
as we poured out our wine. We clinked glasses with
true German fervour, drank with no less, and filled
again. A morsel of foil from the neck of the bottle
was floating in my wine. I turned to the light and
fished it out with a spoon. In so doing, I faced a
mirror, which, set at an angle, and combined with
another at my back, enabled me not only to see over
my shoulder, but showed me what was going on in
front of the man whose back was turned to me.</p>

<p>And this is what I saw.</p>

<p>A peculiar, furtive action on the part of the Count
caught my eye. He was leaning his left arm on the
sideboard, presumably to screen from Von Lindheim
what he did with his right. This hand moved quickly
to an empty glass close by, and, resting over it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>tilted, as though pouring something into it. What the
hand held I could not see. Had not my mind been full
of murder and sudden death, or had the act been
done less stealthily I should perhaps have thought
little of it; many a man doctors his drink against
gout or some other chronic ailment. Even here a
doubt was in my mind; although I could not help an
almost sickening feeling of something very like horror,
and I determined to keep a strict watch. Taking a
sip of my wine, I turned again to the sideboard, still
talking and laughing with my new acquaintance, but
keeping my eye carelessly on the Count. He took
up a bottle, the cork was not drawn, and with a show
of polite alacrity I handed him ours, which was but
half empty. He placed another glass in a line with
the first and filled them. As I expected and feared,
he then pushed them forward in such a manner
that the doctored glass came naturally nearest to
Von Lindheim. My previous night&rsquo;s experience
was enough to tell me of the fearful danger in which
my friend stood. I was determined that he should
not touch that glass, yet what was I to do on the spur
of the moment? A happy thought struck me. &ldquo;Let
us all drink together,&rdquo; I cried, feigning a slightly
elevated manner, at the same time slapping my young
friend on the shoulder, then going quickly round to
the other side of Von Lindheim. &ldquo;We will drink
together all four,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>

<p>Von Lindheim&rsquo;s glance indicated his opinion that I
had taken as much champagne as was good for me;
the Count showed his teeth in a tolerant smile. I
leaned forward to the young fellow who was now
separated from me by the other two men. &ldquo;<i>Prosit!</i>&rdquo;
I cried.</p>

<p>Exactly what I had calculated upon happened.
The Count was obliged to turn slightly in order to
touch the other&rsquo;s glass with his own. At that instant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>I struck Von Lindheim a sharp blow. He
turned to me half startled. &ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; I dared only
form the word with my lips, throwing all the horror
I could into my expression as I nodded towards his
glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink for your life!&rdquo; The words were not
even whispered; happily Von Lindheim was sharp
enough to comprehend the situation. He faced
round to me, so that his back was turned upon the
Count, and next moment our glasses had been changed.
I leaned forward and touched with the other two men;
Von Lindheim did the same, and at a nod from me he
drank some of his wine at which he at first hesitated.
I raised the glass to my lips and pretended to drink,
then I contrived unseen to spill a portion of its contents
over my pocket handkerchief, so that I could
return to my former place, a little unsteadily, with my
glass half empty. All the time my brain was raging
as I realized the hideousness of the business. The
intense pity I felt for my friend comes back to me as
the sensation uppermost in my mind then. But
in that desperate situation action was imperative,
sentiment useless. I kept up my talk with the young
sportsman, watching all the while for an opportunity
of saying a word to Von Lindheim. Presently he
left the Count and came to me. My companion
turned at the moment to relight his cigar, which in
his chattering he had allowed to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better smoke a cigarette,&rdquo; I said to Von
Lindheim under my voice, &ldquo;and then make an excuse
to go. Say you feel unwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I laughed and brought the other man into
the conversation. He and Von Lindheim began to
chat, as the Count, throwing himself into a chair near
us, opened a conversation with me.</p>

<p>We exchanged some commonplaces, the usual
small talk between a visitor and a native. I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>tell he was a man of great tact, natural and acquired.
He invariably said the right thing, passing from topic
to topic with a pleasant, well-rounded comment upon
each, such cut and dried talk as avoids all pitfalls of
argument or contradiction.</p>

<p>He gave an occasional glance at Von Lindheim, but
quite naturally, his manner never showing the least
preoccupation. To all appearances he was a genial,
sociable man of the world, a state official merely by
accident. In his careless way, however, he put a
good many leading questions to me, principally as to
my friendship with Von Lindheim, which I, affecting
the part of a simple-minded sportsman, answered
with a great show of frankness. Presently my friend
laid his hand on my shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me hurry
you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I think of going homewards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already? It is not so late for you, Herr von
Lindheim,&rdquo; Furello remarked almost chaffingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired and feel out of sorts,&rdquo; he replied as
naturally as one could wish. &ldquo;Good-night, Herr
Count. Many thanks for the good offices you have
promised me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bird that goes to perch early. I&rsquo;ll come
too,&rdquo; I said, bowing to the Count, who, to my disgust,
held out his hand&mdash;<i>the</i> hand&mdash;which I was fain to
take.</p>

<p>So we made our adieux and next minute were in the
street.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE BEATING OF DEATH&rsquo;S WINGS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had walked a hundred yards or more, and turned
the corner of the street before either of us spoke.
Then I said, &ldquo;A narrow escape, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked, scarcely above his
breath, and, as he turned towards me, his face looked
ghastly under the lamp.</p>

<p>I told him exactly what I had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a marked man,&rdquo; was all his comment as I
finished my story, and he spoke the words in a tone
of despairing conviction. &ldquo;A marked man, Tyrrell,
my good friend,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;how can I thank
you for having saved my life? Your presence of
mind was wonderful, though I fear your services can
only prolong my agony. I&rsquo;m doomed, lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Lindheim! For Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t
let your nerves go now when you want them most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;Nerves are of no avail
against the powers here. You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;be thankful
you don&rsquo;t. Furello is merely an instrument:
one of many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; I said cheerily, &ldquo;I am going to stand
by you and get you out of this business if it is as bad
as you say. An Englishman doesn&rsquo;t let cowardly
murder go on before his eyes if he can help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is splendidly kind of you, Tyrrell; but you
had better leave me to my fate. If you interfere you
will only share it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>I laughed. &ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Rallenstein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave an apprehensive glance behind. &ldquo;It is
hardly worth while,&rdquo; he said, with an attempt at a
laugh, &ldquo;but we may as well be careful, as we are
probably being watched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you are supposed to be ill; the poison
is taking its effect,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;You had better
stagger and lean on me for the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not need much of an effort to make him
look pretty ill. He went through some appropriate
pantomime, dismal enough when one comes to think
of it, and I pretended to help him along till we came
to his house. As we turned in I certainly seemed to
see the indistinct figure of a man some distance behind
on the other side of the deserted street. Von Lindheim
begged me to stay, and, indeed, I was unwilling
to leave him, having seen enough on both that and
the previous nights to realize that he might stand in
considerable danger, although, had it not been for the
evidence of my own eyes, I should probably have set
down his own fears as rather childish.</p>

<p>In the house we found Szalay waiting, pacing the
room in a perturbed state of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>Von Lindheim flung down his hat. &ldquo;We had
better both make our wills, Szalay,&rdquo; he cried in
desperation.</p>

<p>Szalay&rsquo;s face turned greenish grey. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
settle it, then?&rdquo; he asked nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nearly settled myself in trying to,&rdquo; the
other returned grimly. &ldquo;I went to the Baroness&rsquo;s
to give Furello a hint, with the result that, but for
our friend here, I should have been carried home on
four shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven! what do you mean?&rdquo; Szalay&rsquo;s eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>were almost starting from his head as he gasped out
the question.</p>

<p>Von Lindheim related the story of his escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own idea is,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;that
the whole business, your challenge, and my invitation,
are simply methods to get rid of us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was silence, the silence of almost hopeless
fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; Szalay asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>Von Lindheim gave a shrug. Then, to relieve the
tension, I spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it asking too much, as I mean to stand by you
fellows, that you should tell me the reason of all this;
what you saw last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not ask, my dear Tyrrell; the knowledge
is fatal&mdash;too fatal, already. D&rsquo;Urban is missing
too,&rdquo; he went on, in a fresh access of despair. &ldquo;Poor
D&rsquo;Urban, dead by now, probably. And Orsova, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw his death,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the papers to-night, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I returned quietly; &ldquo;I was present at his
death last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; they both gasped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly. In the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suicide? No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was and it wasn&rsquo;t. Tell me what you
saw, and you shall hear all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Lindheim walked to the mantel and leaned
against it. &ldquo;We are doomed, Szalay. We are
both dead men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His colleague had turned away to hide, perhaps,
the fear that was in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you fellows see?&rdquo; I repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Von Lindheim answered, with a short
laugh of desperation, &ldquo;to make our lives forfeit.
The devil must have led us to investigate that light.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sight for which we have now to pay,&rdquo; Szalay
broke in bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little chapel was just dimly lighted by a pair
of candles,&rdquo; Von Lindheim proceeded. &ldquo;Through a
light-coloured pane in the low window we could see
a priest in vestments standing before what had once
been the altar. It was curious. He seemed the only
person in the chapel. Soon he looked up, as though
at the entrance of some one, and opened the book in
his hand. Three people, a man and two ladies, came
quickly up the chapel and placed themselves before
him at the altar. You may guess who two of them
were. Von Orsova and the Princess Casilde. They
had come to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! That accounts for everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than accounts for it,&rdquo; my friend continued
grimly. &ldquo;Well, when we realized what the scene
meant, the spirit of caution took possession of us;
we were chance spectators of what was practically
an act of high treason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accessories in effect,&rdquo; Szalay put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two courses open to us,&rdquo; Von Lindheim
went on. &ldquo;To interrupt the ceremony, or to
steal away and keep our own counsel. Our evil
genius prompted us all three to choose the latter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The former was too dangerous,&rdquo; Szalay said.
&ldquo;We knew too much; even in that case we should
have been marked men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; the other proceeded, &ldquo;we crept away
from the window and hurried back through the wood
to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; Szalay said. &ldquo;We should
have run the other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fatal mistake. For we came plump upon two
men hastening towards the chapel. One ran on,
the other halted and scrutinized us, then followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>his companion. The Jaguar, and his striking paw,
Furello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two I saw,&rdquo; was my remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now you see the man, the fiend, and his
methods,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said. &ldquo;He did not strike
at once, but watched the marriage to an end, that he
might strike more surely and quietly. Now we have
the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far. It is not ended,&rdquo; Szalay said gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear it is I who have unwittingly betrayed you,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Furello could but have guessed before he
cross-questioned me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A guess is enough for Rallenstein. He makes
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I feel guilty,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and am determined
to stand by you both if you will let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better start for England to-night,&rdquo; Von Lindheim
replied gloomily, &ldquo;before you share our fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed. &ldquo;Even your Chancellor will think
twice before he murders a British subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murders? No. My dear Tyrrell, your death
would be of the most deplorably accidental description.
Rallenstein is above all things an artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to desert you fellows, so
please don&rsquo;t suggest it. Now you shall know what
I saw last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I told them of the chance which had made
me a witness of Von Orsova&rsquo;s death. Needless to say
the recital did not tend to allay their fears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rittmeister has paid!&rdquo; Szalay exclaimed,
with a lugubrious jerk of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what crime can there be in
what you saw in that glance through the window?
If that is motive enough for getting rid of you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Motive enough,&rdquo; Von Lindheim returned. &ldquo;If
you knew what we could tell you, you would not be
surprised. In this country a whisper, a shrug, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>laugh are, any one of them, enough to bring a man
to his death. And the innocent have often to suffer
for the guilty&mdash;to make sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is clear enough,&rdquo; Szalay added, pacing the
room. &ldquo;This <i>affaire</i> Orsova is likely to upset the
Chancellor&rsquo;s plans. If it were to become a scandal,
the alliance he has set his heart and the King&rsquo;s upon
would never come to anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one was heard below, and Von Lindheim ran
to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only Pabst,&rdquo; he said, coming back with a
relieved face. &ldquo;I had forgotten he was out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and Pabst came in.
He was Von Lindheim&rsquo;s housekeeper and factotum, a
respectable elderly man. He looked perturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, meine Herren,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did not
know Herr Szalay was here. He has doubtless
brought you the bad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two colleagues looked at each other in renewed
fear. &ldquo;What bad news?&rdquo; Von Lindheim asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the death of the Herr Rittmeister
von Orsova,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, mein Herr,&rdquo; Pabst answered, with a
grave shake of the head, &ldquo;it is nearer than that.
Herr D&rsquo;Urban&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The terror in both men made them cry
out simultaneously. But the good Pabst probably
read nothing in their faces beyond ignorance, and
concern for the fate of a colleague.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is most unhappily drowned,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drowned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They found his body in the river this evening near
the Powder Mills. They say his mother, poor
lady, is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But D&rsquo;Urban was a swimmer,&rdquo; Szalay cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could swim well,&rdquo; Von Lindheim said gloomily.
&ldquo;But of what avail was that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;True, mein Herr,&rdquo; Pabst chimed in. &ldquo;He has
an ugly blow on his head. They say he must have
been carried over the Tollert Fall, struck against a
rock or pile, and so been stunned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His turn has come first,&rdquo; Von Lindheim observed
grimly when the old servant had left the room. He
seemed to be growing reckless now from the very
hopelessness of his situation. &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;
he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing is settled,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You and Herr
Szalay are going to face this danger, if it exists, and
will not give up your lives without a struggle. Surely,
Lindheim, there is some law, some authority to which
you can appeal for protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in these days of civilization men are not
butchered in cold blood without an appeal to law and
justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Civilization,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is a very pretty
word for occasions. We are proud of it, in theory,
but it is never allowed to stand in the way of political
expediency. The head of all law and authority in this
country is the Chancellor; the King himself is but
his creature, and Rallenstein&rsquo;s methods are, when
necessary, quite mediæval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But men in your position&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! He would have the King poisoned to-morrow
if it suited his purpose. We have no party
government here, worse luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is nothing to do but to find a way of
escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Escape? Outwit the Jaguar!&rdquo; He laughed
at the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try, anyhow. Let us view the situation
calmly. You are supposed to have drunk that dose
of Furello&rsquo;s, and are dying. We have the start of
them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>He made an impatient gesture. &ldquo;It comes to the
same in the end; the agony is only prolonged.
Better get it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. You have a chance, and a good one.
I tell you both you must not be so mad and wicked
as to throw it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, and perhaps catching hope from
my confident manner, they made an effort to look
more cheerfully at the business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be half a chance,&rdquo; Von Lindheim
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be none,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you give up.
We have three heads here, and we know our danger.
You mean to fight for your life, eh, Herr Szalay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Szalay tried to smile, but could only achieve a
ghastly grimace. &ldquo;I am not yet tired of my life, and
am ready to make an effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Now for our plans. We
must hoodwink this autocratic butcher. Send for a
doctor; the most stupid in the place, for choice.
Who answers to that description?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Lindheim thought a moment. &ldquo;Doctor
Rothmer, I should think, eh, Szalay? The man
who killed the Reichsrath Lorenz by treating him for
indigestion when he had peritonitis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pompous idiot, eh? Just the man. Send
for him at once, and turn into bed. Recollect you
are poisoned; but don&rsquo;t tell the doctor that. All you
know is that you have been supping abroad and are
horribly ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rang, and told Pabst to send for the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I? What am I to do?&rdquo; Szalay inquired
with almost ludicrous concern. &ldquo;I am not poisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You have simply got to keep quiet and
not be seen. Your second is taken suddenly ill and
cannot act for you. I may be able to avert the
meeting; at any rate to delay it. Anyhow, we must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>work to throw our enemies off their guard. That&rsquo;s
the vague plan I have at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Szalay brightened. My taking things so coolly
seemed to give him confidence. The whole business
was an eye-opener certainly; and after what I had seen
there was no room for doubt that the Chancellor and
his people meant business. However, funk and flurry
would do no good. I, being somewhat involved in
the affair, was prepared to see it through, and take my
chance of trying any of the pleasant little ways the
authorities seemed to have for disposing of awkward
onlookers. Whether I had let these men in for the
trouble or not I was resolved to get them out, and I
thought I could do it.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE DUEL</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was a self-important, incompetent fellow; I
could see that, and so just the man for our purpose.
I had impressed upon Von Lindheim that his life
depended on his playing his part well, and I must say
there was no fault to be found with his performance.
He appeared to be in great agony, while Szalay and I,
with a great show of excitement and distress, told
the doctor a plausible tale of the sudden seizure.
Finally, I laid stress upon the suddenness of the
attack in perfect health, and suggested ptomaine
poisoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; the fellow returned, well pleased at
finding himself taken for rather more than even he
pretended to be. &ldquo;The symptoms certainly point
to the presence of poisonous matter in the system,
and we must, at all events, take measures to counteract
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly he did take measures, which the patient
in turn took good care to neutralize. The doctor
was so fussy and stupid that we found no difficulty
in contriving that he should not make an examination
which might have betrayed, even to him, the real
state of the case.</p>

<p>Presently he bustled off to prepare a draught. I
offered to accompany him to his house, and hurry
back with the potion, so that it might be given without
delay. As I opened the door to go out a young
fellow came up, an officer by his uniform, and asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>for Von Lindheim. I guessed at once that he was
the second of the fire-eating Captain de Hayn, and
rejoiced that he had arrived at that moment.</p>

<p>I saluted him punctiliously. &ldquo;Herr von Lindheim
has, I regret to say, been taken ill, dangerously ill.
It is impossible for you to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I expected, the young fellow gave an incredulous
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, sir? My&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cut him short. &ldquo;Here is the doctor, who will
confirm what I tell you. You know Dr. Rothmer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not know Dr. Rothmer, but happily that
good man&rsquo;s profession was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indeed the case,&rdquo; he said pompously. &ldquo;Herr
von Lindheim is seriously ill. I cannot allow you to
see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will step in for a moment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
will tell Herr von Lindheim that you are here, and
will follow you, doctor, directly.&rdquo; The professional
was bustled off, and I took Lieutenant Paulssen into
the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume you have called to see Von Lindheim
about the affair in which he is acting for Herr Szalay.
Von Lindheim has only just asked me to inform Herr
Szalay of his illness, and to request him to find
another second. But I hope, Lieutenant, your visit
may be to say that it is unnecessary; that this deplorable,
this absurd affair is at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young fellow seemed to bristle with resentful
importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he returned uncompromisingly; &ldquo;that
is by no means my mission. And I must request you,
sir, to refrain from referring to an insult to our
army as absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I changed my tone to one of easy familiarity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Lieutenant, my expression absurd was
very far from being applied to the honour of your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>corps, which I am sure you, as a gallant soldier, hold
above everything in the world. What I meant was
the idea of poor Szalay measuring swords with so renowned
a fighter as your principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his epauletted shoulders. &ldquo;It is
unfortunate,&rdquo; he responded stiffly. &ldquo;But Herr
Szalay should have remembered that before uttering
words of disrespect concerning Captain de Hayn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand he has no recollection of having
done so; he is ready&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, mein Herr,&rdquo; he interrupted with a
formality, brusque in its uncertain touch, &ldquo;if I
decline to discuss the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed. &ldquo;You have every right to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will stand no shuffling,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I swear
I will not eat my breakfast till the affair has come off.
If Herr von Lindheim is ill, then Herr Szalay must find
another friend, or take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;if Von Lindheim&rsquo;s illness
continues, Herr Szalay will find another friend. But
you can hardly expect him to do so by breakfast
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He twirled his silly little moustache, and put on one
of the most stupidly offensive looks it has ever been
my fortune to see on a human countenance. &ldquo;You,
sir,&rdquo; he said blusteringly, &ldquo;you seem to be at pains to
champion Herr Szalay; what is there to prevent your
acting as his friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the fact that he has not honoured me by
asking me to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absurd, this attempt to play fast and loose,&rdquo;
he spluttered. &ldquo;We shall not permit it, that I
swear. I am surprised that any one should counsel
delay. Delay in an affair of this sort, sir, we hold as a
coward&rsquo;s word. And if you have any regard for your
friend&rsquo;s honour you will see that this business is
settled at once. I shall not go to bed to-night, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>shall expect to receive Herr Szalay&rsquo;s friend. That is
my last word; I have a duty to perform. I have the
honour, sir. Good evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made me a bow which was meant, no doubt, to
be the quintessence of military dignity, and clattered
from the room. I let him go, seeing that an appeal
to common sense was worse than hopeless. Then I
went up, and gave the two men an account of my
interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; Lindheim said, &ldquo;even if there had ever
been a doubt about it, this ridiculous duel is simply
a trick of the Jaguar&rsquo;s to get rid of our friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear that is certain,&rdquo; I assented.</p>

<p>Szalay had sat in a gloomy silence, and, appreciating
his feelings, I had taken little notice of him. He now
rather astonished me by starting up and exclaiming,
&ldquo;I will fight! I will fight this duel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; I observed laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will!&rdquo; he repeated, pacing the room in a
state of nervous excitement. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me
mad; it is by far the most sensible course to take.
I have got to die; my life is forfeit; the Jaguar
never turns off from the prey he has marked down.
Better a thousand times fall by a soldier&rsquo;s bullet in
open day, when the chances are nominally equal, than
be done to death in secret by one of Rallenstein&rsquo;s
butchers. Yes, my friends, I am resolved; do not
try to turn me.&rdquo; For we had simultaneously began
to exclaim against his decision. &ldquo;Herr Tyrrell, if you
will honour me by standing my friend, it would be a
great favour, the last I shall probably ask of any man;
if you will see this Paulssen and arrange the meeting
for as soon after daybreak as possible. I have the
courage now and am in the mood; who knows how
long it may last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sheer suicide,&rdquo; I remonstrated; &ldquo;if this De
Hayn is a dead shot, and you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;I am to die assuredly within the
next forty-eight hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily!&rdquo; I objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a tower of strength, Herr Tyrrell,&rdquo;
he replied wistfully. &ldquo;But even you cannot stand
against our King Jaguar, and in any event you will
have enough to do to save our friend here. Now will
you go to Paulssen at once? I ask you as a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not to be dissuaded, and perhaps both
Von Lindheim and I had a secret feeling that, on his
chances, the course he urged had something to commend
it. So, after waiting for a comedy scene with
the doctor, who paid us another fussy visit, during
which he nearly succeeded in making his patient
actually swallow a manifestly loathsome draught,
I went off to Lieutenant Paulssen&rsquo;s lodgings and
arranged preliminaries for the meeting which was to
take place at daybreak. My pugnacious friend was
sullenly gratified, receiving my communication with
a significant, &ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having a pretty shrewd idea of the fellow&rsquo;s sense
and capabilities, I wasted no time, but simply and
curtly settled the necessary details of the meeting,
and returned to Von Lindheim&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The rest of the night I spent in coaching my poor
principal in the use of his weapon. I had on his
behalf naturally chosen pistols for the encounter, as
giving a rather better chance; with swords he would
have been as a sheep before a butcher.</p>

<p>The poor fellow attended to my instructions in a
mechanical, half-dazed fashion; he was utterly
without hope, indeed, clearly in the apathy of despair.
But we did our best to cheer him, and I took pains to
impress upon him one or two wrinkles which might
possibly give a slender chance in his favour.</p>

<p>In the dull grey of a chilly dawn we set out for the
place of meeting, and certainly it was the most dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>agreeable
errand on which I ever started. On the
way my companion tried to talk on different subjects,
even to jest on his situation and its almost certain
issue; but it was all so hideously forced as a cover to
his despair, that it would have been far less painful to
me had he kept silence.</p>

<p>The rendezvous was a short distance outside the
city, the less frequented side of a common bordered
by a plantation. Being before our time we were first
on the ground, and I utilized the interval of waiting
in reiterating the instructions I already had given
Szalay; but he was in such a piteous state of nervousness
that to me, as the affair had to be gone through
with, it was a relief when the other party appeared.
They were three: De Hayn, Paulssen, and a professional-looking
person, evidently the surgeon whom
Paulssen had arranged to bring.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the sight of the trio and the
approach of the critical moment had the effect of
steadying Szalay&rsquo;s nerves somewhat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they have brought the doctor,&rdquo; he laughed;
&ldquo;it is just as well to do everything in order, even a
murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chances are if he hits you it won&rsquo;t be in a
vital part,&rdquo; I said to comfort him. &ldquo;Now, mind;
take steady aim on the first sight and get your fire in
before his, it&rsquo;s your best chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The account given of the fire-eating Captain de
Hayn had not been over-coloured. It seemed impossible
that five feet four inches of humanity could
hold a greater quantity of truculent conceit than was
manifestly compressed into his personality. A greater
contrast between this business-like little butcher, with
his bronzed&mdash;and brazen&mdash;countenance, and poor
Szalay, trying to control his shaking nerves and keep
a manly look on his grey face, could not be imagined.
Principals and seconds saluted punctiliously, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>the doctor gave Szalay and me a bow, his expression
being nicely differentiated as between the humane
reserve towards a dying patient, and the grave announcement
of a hopeless case to his friends.</p>

<p>Paulssen and I measured the ground, while the
doctor, with professional glib deliberation, set out his
case of instruments.</p>

<p>All was ready; we placed our men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring down your pistol with decision, and fire
first,&rdquo; I again enjoined in a whisper.</p>

<p>If ever a man was sick at the irony and unfairness
of life I was then, as I drew back from that poor
fellow, already, as it seemed, half-dead. Indeed, I
remember wondering how he contrived to keep so
steady. I glanced at his dapper little opponent,
standing in professional duellist&rsquo;s style, not the easiest
of marks for a good shot; to my man practically
invisible. Paulssen was to give the word; the
usual One! Two! Three! Perhaps he had anticipated
my instructions to Szalay as to firing if possible
before his adversary: the usual advice given to a
novice at the game. Anyhow, he made a deliberate
pause between One! and Two! but none between
Two! and Three!</p>

<p>The reports appeared to be simultaneous; next I
heard Paulssen utter an oath as he rushed forward
to his man, followed by the doctor. As fate would
have it, the unexpected had happened. Szalay
was untouched, while De Hayn, the victor in a dozen
encounters, lay prone on the turf with a bullet through
his heart.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">AN ASYLUM</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> may be imagined, we returned to Von Lindheim&rsquo;s
in a very different state of mind from that in which
we had set out. Our friend&rsquo;s surprise at seeing Szalay,
whom he had already looked upon as a dead man,
was only equalled by his delight. But we realized
that Szalay&rsquo;s providential escape had only increased
the danger of the situation. No time was to be lost
now in forming a plan of escape. We agreed that it
must be effected that morning, before Rallenstein
might have time to set his emissaries of death on our
track. Both the result of the duel and the pretence
of illness would give colour to a precipitate move
from Buyda. As a dying man, Von Lindheim was
to be conveyed to a country house he had at Schönval,
some twenty miles from the capital. And indeed, if
he was really to die, he would prefer that the blow
should fall there; and in that stronghold we felt we
might turn at bay and at least gain time, if flight out
of the country, too dangerous now, should subsequently
seem feasible. Then came the question&mdash;what
was to become of poor Szalay? He stood in
equal danger. We could not, for humanity&rsquo;s sake,
leave him to his fate. If we did he would most
assuredly be a dead man within twenty-four hours.
But how to get him away under the lynx eyes of
Rallenstein and his creatures? After many plans
we decided upon doing the best we could to disguise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>him as a servant, and so taking him down to Schönval
with us.</p>

<p>He was a fair-faced man with reddish hair and
beard. We made him shave, blackened his hair
and eyebrows, found some paint and gave his complexion
a ruddy tinge; then we dressed him in an
extra suit of Pabst&rsquo;s, and flattered ourselves the disguise
would pass even under Count Furello&rsquo;s eye.
Anyhow, when he finally saw himself in the glass
he hardly recognized his own identity, and behind his
effective mask began to take courage. But it was an
anxious time for all of us. I was too concerned
for the awful peril in which my friends stood to
appreciate fully the adventurous side of the business.
Fighting against these underhand methods of assassination
was not quite to my taste. Still, the danger was
real enough, and that had to be met.</p>

<p>Having come to a decision, we sent hastily for Dr.
Rothmer. After our anxious vigil Von Lindheim
looked pale and drawn enough to support his pretended
symptoms. When we mentioned his desire to
be taken to his country home, the doctor, as we foresaw,
strongly objected to any such move. He was not
going to lose fees if he could help it.</p>

<p>We appeared rather to fall in with his views, intending
all the same to make a start when he had
gone, and simply mentioning the matter for the sake
of plausibility. Von Lindheim lay groaning, with a
stimulated quick respiration and signs of collapse in
which we had coached him. The doctor looked grave,
shook his head at the difficulty of combating ptomaine
poisoning, and finally, having impressed upon us the
patient&rsquo;s extremely critical state, went off, promising
to send another draught, which might relieve the
symptoms.</p>

<p>No sooner had he left us than we began to prepare
for our flight. We had settled that the first part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>the journey should be made by road, for the reason
that by railway we should be more open to observation.
So we proposed driving to a country station about
eight miles distant, and then catching a train to our
destination.</p>

<p>The move was carried out successfully; at least
without hindrance. Half an hour sufficed to make
our preparations and have a roomy carriage at the
door; our pseudo-invalid was borne out and laid in it,
Szalay, in his new guise, helping in the work. So we
started, leaving the faithful Pabst to answer inquiries;
our departure and manner of travelling being
plausible enough.</p>

<p>So far as we could tell, our move had been quite
unobserved. The street was comparatively deserted,
as it would be at that early hour, and as we drove off
and got clear of the city, we congratulated ourselves
that, so far, we had given the slip to the Jaguar,
and at least had a good start of any pursuit. It was a
bright morning, and as we rolled along over the country
roads lined with dew-sparkling hedges, the gloom
of the situation seemed to have lifted with that of the
night. The brilliancy of the day seemed to give the
two despairing men a new zest for life, and with that
came courage. Even poor Szalay could discuss his
position calmly and more hopefully; we could have
laughed at the absurd alteration in his appearance but
for the thought that he had taken a man&rsquo;s life that
day. We presently slackened our pace, that we
might arrive at the wayside station just when the
train was due. This we hit off very successfully,
and carried our invalid tenderly, with anxious faces,
into an empty compartment. No other passengers
were at the station, with the exception of a couple of
old market women, and we felt sure they were genuine.
An attentive guard found us a carriage and assisted
us, rather officiously, it seemed; but then first-class
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>passengers were rare at those little stations. At each
stoppage he came to look after us, and at the end of
the short but tedious journey, he helped us out and
bustled about us with rather more assiduity than was
agreeable. However, before we were able to leave
the station for Schönval we had seen him whistle the
train off and depart with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite like that guard,&rdquo; Von Lindheim
said as we drove away.</p>

<p>I reasoned with him against his uneasiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you forget,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;our railways are
state property. The man may very well be in the
Chancellor&rsquo;s employ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he is miles away by this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here we are at home,&rdquo; he exclaimed with a
sigh of relief. &ldquo;Safe so far.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A COURT PHYSICIAN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schönvalhof</span> was an old grey stone house, standing
not far from the foot of pine-covered hills. A substantial
dwelling, its interior more comfortable and
homelike than my first view of its somewhat rugged
exterior led me to expect. It was, they told me, built
on a part of the site of an old Baronial castle, some
ruins of which still stood adjacent to the modern house.
A couple of old family servants made us comfortable
at the short notice, and we had decided that, for a time
at least, Lindheim should continue his rôle of the
sick man; Szalay that of his personal attendant.
We felt it would be madness for either of them to
venture out of doors just then, so the pretence of
illness could be kept up without much deprivation.</p>

<p>For we were certain that we should be followed,
and that attempts would be made to get quietly rid of
the witnesses of that fatal marriage. How the next
blow would be aimed, from what quarter it would
come, we could not even conjecture. But that it
was to be looked for we all were certain. If there
was one quality which in Chancellor Rallenstein was
distinguished above another, it was tenacity of
purpose. To him a temporary baffling was but a
provocative; the slightest hint of opposition at once
banished all hesitation. So we had every reason to
feel sure that he would draw the net round us. Still,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>life was strong in the two marked victims, and the
longer we could put off the stroke the more chance
there might be of fate coming to our rescue. Nothing
but that, they felt. Help from outside it was vain to
look for. For in that small independent State the
supreme power, that is, of the Chancellor, was a law
unto itself. His authority was boundless and answerable
to no one, and if the deaths of two or three of
the King&rsquo;s subjects were necessary for motives of
State policy, why, short of a revolution, Rallenstein
had no reckoning to fear. My case, as a British subject,
I felt was different; not that I could consider myself
by any means outside the danger line. I was in the
<i>galère</i>, or&mdash;what was more to the point&mdash;in the secret,
and had little doubt that a &ldquo;regrettable accident&rdquo;
was being prepared for me. Our one satisfaction was
in the thought that the Jaguar would have to
crawl warily and strike silently, knowing that a
bungle would probably mean the publishing of the
secret he was taking so much trouble to keep. And
this was where I, vaguely enough, saw a ray of
hope.</p>

<p>For two or three days we lived quietly without the
smallest sign of molestation; no stranger, nothing
abnormal was noticed about the place&mdash;and I kept a
sharp look-out&mdash;till we almost began to fancy that
we were to be let alone. A formal letter had been
sent informing the authorities of Von Lindheim&rsquo;s
illness as an excuse for his absenting himself from
his duties, and of this a mere acknowledgment had
been received. That was all. Of Szalay we said
nothing, and we hoped Rallenstein&rsquo;s spies had no
scent of his whereabouts. Certainly, it would not
have been so easy to give a valid excuse for his
absence.</p>

<p>So, as the days passed, we seemed to gain more
confidence and hope from detecting no sign of danger;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>at least, we got to look at the bright side of the business,
till suddenly a rude awakening came.</p>

<p>But first of all, to take the history of those anxious
days in order. Von Lindheim received one morning
an official letter, inquiring as to his health, and saying,
further, that the King had heard with concern of the
serious and regretted illness of such an esteemed member
of his royal service, and had graciously commanded
that the Herr Hof-Artzt Beckmeister should pay
the patient a visit on behalf of his Majesty, who
trusted to receive a more favourable report of Herr
von Lindheim&rsquo;s condition. This letter filled my friends
with dismay. But the move was so obvious and
natural that the only wonder was it had not been
foreseen. I asked what manner of man the Court
Physician was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a dandified old scoundrel; a humbug as a
doctor, but no fool. And he has skill enough, acting
upon a hint, to diagnose that I have nothing the
matter with me. Of course it is obvious what he is
sent down for. He is a creature of Rallenstein&rsquo;s, who,
however, does not employ him when he himself is
ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must do the best we can with him,&rdquo; I said,
turning over in my mind various tricks to that end.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t keep him from seeing and examining you,
and of course that means discovery that you are in
more or less robust health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they must think I drank the poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s in our favour. And that is the idea
we must work. The dose was too small, and consequently
only partly operative. The physical effects
have now passed off, but they have left brain trouble,
and your nerves are shattered. Herr Hof-Artzt
Beckmeister is presumably no brain specialist nor an
authority on the after-effects of certain, or rather uncertain,
poisons. His stethoscope and thermometer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>will tell him nothing to refute our story; he may
have suspicions, but that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we planned the conduct of the interview, and I,
at any rate, awaited with a certain amused curiosity
the arrival of Herr Beckmeister.</p>

<p>He came next morning in a hired carriage from the
station. A dressed-up, brushed-up villain, with
diamond rings, studs and pin, a heavy gold watch
chain, gold-rimmed eyeglasses, and gold-knobbed
malacca stick. A crafty, sensual face, and a sharp
eye that meant business. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
had your instructions, that&rsquo;s plain.&rdquo; But I received
him with all the respect which would have been his
due had he been the man he pretended, and possibly
believed himself, to be.</p>

<p>His Majesty had graciously honoured him with a
command to visit my friend. Herr von Lindheim
was better to-day, he ventured to hope.</p>

<p>I thereupon described the illness, somewhat differently,
perhaps, from the visitor&rsquo;s expectation. My
friend and I had supped on such an evening at the
house of a charming lady in Buyda&mdash;possibly well
known to the Herr Hof-Artzt, the Baroness Fornbach.
The Herr Hof-Artzt conveyed by a bow and a smirk
that he was one of that lady&rsquo;s circle. &ldquo;On the way
home,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;my friend was taken alarmingly
ill. I got him with difficulty to his house; he was
put to bed.&rdquo; I described his symptoms. &ldquo;But he
grew so much worse that we feared he would not live
through the night, which was likewise the opinion of
the doctor we called in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Rothmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Herr Hof-Artzt groaned and gave a shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the morning, however, my friend felt easier,
but in oppressive fear of death. His one idea was to
reach his home and die here. The desire seemed so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>strong that I hastily procured a carriage and brought
him hither in the hope that the change would restore
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it has?&rdquo; he asked expectantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a great, great measure. The alarming bodily
symptoms have subsided, but, Herr Doctor, it
seems as though a worse calamity had befallen
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; He looked at me curiously, but I
think could make nothing of my anxious, innocent
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I fear his brain is affected. He is painfully
nervous, and is under the impression that he has been
maliciously poisoned. He rambles about enemies
who are seeking his life, and all my reasoning cannot
persuade him of his fallacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Herr Beckmeister looked sharply at me, so
sharply that I wondered how much of the business he
knew. Then he rose, and, pulling out just the watch
I should have imagined him to carry, a showy monstrosity,
with a gaudily enamelled device on each
side of the case, suggested, as he wished to catch a
certain train back, he should see the patient. As this
was inevitable, I led the way with a great show of
alacrity, even thankfulness, and showing him Von
Lindheim&rsquo;s room, left them together.</p>

<p>We had planned that Von Lindheim should very
vaguely, yet with a mad insistence, take the Doctor
into his confidence, and by a long recital of supposed
danger keep him from a too searching examination.
Whether it succeeded or not we never knew. When,
after a twenty minutes&rsquo; interview, Beckmeister
came out of the room, he would give nothing
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;seems in surprisingly
good bodily health after what we have heard
of his attack. You will understand, however, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>my report is for His Majesty&rsquo;s ear, and that etiquette
forbids me to forecast it even to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So with another flourish of his abominable watch,
and some vague expressions of sympathy, he bowed
himself into the carriage and drove off.</p>

<p class="ph3">A MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> more happened for a day or two, except that
Von Lindheim received a letter asking him to send
word as soon as possible when he would be able to
resume his duties, the Hof-Artzt having reported his
opinion that the indisposition was only temporary.
The letter concluded with a compliment to Von
Lindheim&rsquo;s ability, and an expression of regret that
the bureau should be deprived of his valued services
at a time when their loss was being particularly felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They want to entice me back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So
much for their fair words. That is a stroke of the
Jaguar&rsquo;s soft paw with the claws ready to spring out.
I know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His impression was, that he had puzzled, if not
quite deceived, Doctor Beckmeister. He flattered
himself that he had played his part well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they think I am really off my head they may
treat me as a neglectable factor, and so give me a
chance of escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was the question of Szalay. We had no
opportunity of learning how his disappearance had
been taken. Of course his presence at Schönval was a
distinct source of danger, inasmuch as it absolutely
contradicted the part Von Lindheim was playing, if
only it were known. This, however, we hoped was not
the case. We had elaborated his disguise, and even the
Chancellor&rsquo;s suspicious eye could hardly have recognized
in the dark, sleek-looking attendant on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>invalid the red-haired, bristling, lively Szalay of our
Buyda days. Our plan was to wait awhile, and then
to take an opportunity of sending him out of the
country to some friends who lived on the other side
of the Alps.</p>

<p>But as every day safely passed was making us more
hopeful of ultimate escape from those vicious claws,
our hopes were dashed by an extraordinary occurrence
which revived our worst fears, and which I will relate
in detail.</p>

<p>It will be understood that I ignored all necessity for
keeping myself a prisoner, as the others had to do.
Personally, although at times I conceived it quite
possible that Rallenstein might not be sorry for a
plausible opportunity of putting me out of the way,
I felt no fear, and went about the place as I felt inclined,
merely taking the precaution of carrying
loaded in my pocket the small revolver with which I
always travelled. I walked about the village, rode
over the country round, but never saw anything
suspicious, nothing in which could be discerned the
Jaguar&rsquo;s watching eye, until the evening I am about to
speak of.</p>

<p>I had strolled out after dinner, as was my wont, in
company with a favourite dog of Von Lindheim&rsquo;s, a
fine wolf-hound, which I often took with me on my
rides. My evening strolls were as much in the nature
of a patrol as a constitutional, but, as I have said, I
had never detected anything to warrant them. On
this occasion I went across the garden, then through a
belt of plantation, and so on to a long terraced walk,
lined on either hand with conifers, and having on one
side occasional gaps, giving on to an arable field
sloping down to a road some quarter of a mile below.
These openings had been made to afford passing
glimpses of what was a charming view, with a small
river winding its course on the other side of the road,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>and, beyond, the pine woods stretching away in broken
masses as far as the eye could reach. The land between
our terrace and the road was divided into small
fields by hedges running longitudinally, useless divisions,
except that they broke up the stretch of furrow,
and so improved the landscape. The fields were now
green with springing wheat, and dotted here and
there over them were dummy scarecrows, a very
necessary, if feeble defence, against the multitudes of
birds that were harboured in the woods beyond. I
mention all these details as being necessary to the
comprehension of what follows.</p>

<p>I strolled along the walk thinking of the situation,
the dog running now behind now in front of me. We
had been getting more hopeful; our plan now being
that we should wait a little longer, and then all three
make our way out of the country. The two men would
take up their abode in Paris, or possibly go to England
with me, not to return to their home until Rallenstein&rsquo;s
power was at an end, or at least until the turn of
political events gave them assurance that they could
breathe their native air in safety.</p>

<p>I had taken a turn and a half along the terrace
when a sharp, low bark of suspicion from the dog
broke the silence round, and aroused my attention.
&ldquo;Hey, Fritz, old fellow! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I
cried.</p>

<p>The dog was running to and fro with his nose to
earth, growling and whining excitedly. I went
through the opening to the edge of the field and stood
watching him. It was now dusk, and nothing could
be clearly seen beyond a distance of, say, fifty yards.
The dog was evidently on the scent of something; on
a strange scent, I thought; one, to judge by his
manner, that aroused his instinctive suspicion. He
was evidently trying to find where the scent led away,
but in this for a while he was in fault. Suddenly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>however, he gave louder tongue and darted off. I
went through the opening, and ran along the crest of
the hill in the direction Fritz had taken. He had got
some distance ahead, and I could see nothing of him
in the gathering darkness. After going some way,
I stopped and whistled. There was no response to
that, but a few seconds after, as I was about to call
again, there came a loud, angry bark, with a deep
cry (I could not swear, but it seemed to me human),
and the snarling growl of a dog in the act of seizure,
abruptly stopping, then silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, he has caught something!&rdquo; I cried,
and ran towards the point whence the noise had come.
Nothing unusual was to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fritz!&rdquo; I called, then whistled. No answer.
Dead silence. Fairly puzzled now, I ran on. Then
thinking that I had gone too far, I wheeled round and
went back towards the terrace, walking slowly, and
looking well about me. Suddenly in the semi-darkness
I sprang forward with a cry of anger. The
mystery of the silence at least was solved.</p>

<p>This is what I came upon.</p>

<p>An overthrown scarecrow, and Fritz lying stretched
on the ground beside it. I called him, although
something told me it was useless, he would never
move again. So it was. There was a great wound
in his throat, and his head lay in a pool of blood.</p>

<p>What had happened? I jumped up and looked
round, pulling out my revolver. I listened intently.
Not a sound. I ran down the field to the road,
keeping as sharp a look-out as was possible. No
one was to be seen. I broke through the hedge and
searched the bank of the river, but with no greater
result. Then returning to the sloping field, I beat
the hedges that crossed it, but came across neither
man nor beast.</p>

<p>So at last there was nothing for it but to abandon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>the search, and take in the uncomfortable tidings to
Von Lindheim, since there was no chance of hiding
them from him, Fritz being his favourite companion.
Both men were greatly perturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us alarm ourselves unnecessarily,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Poor Fritz may have fallen a victim to one
of his natural enemies&mdash;a boar from the forest. At
the same time it might be wise for us to accept it as a
sign of danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For I had little doubt in my own mind that the
unfortunate dog&rsquo;s death-wound had been given by
no boar&rsquo;s tusk, but by a human hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE STONE SARCOPHAGUS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz&rsquo;s</span> death remained a mystery, at the solution of
which we could only hazard various conjectures.
But that it was a man&rsquo;s work I had little doubt.
The death-wound in the throat was the clean stab
of a knife or dagger. My idea was that the man, a
spy, had been hiding in order to watch us, and being
attacked by the dog had silenced him in the most
effectual manner; then before I could follow, making
his escape under cover of the nearest hedge, which
would hide his retreat right down to the road, whence,
if he thought it necessary, he could cross the river,
and get off into the woods, when pursuit would be
hopeless.</p>

<p>But, whatever the explanation of the affair might
be, it had happened so swiftly and so mysteriously as
to cause a very uneasy feeling, a serious apprehension
for my friends&rsquo; lives, which I could not disguise from
myself. Now I was indeed beginning to realize the
malignant tenacity of Chancellor Rallenstein. All
the same, this fresh evidence rather braced my
determination to outwit him. I gave up my long
rides in the country round, and confined myself to
walking about the grounds and the village, keeping a
sharper look-out than ever.</p>

<p>A very uncomfortable feeling is that of being
secretly watched. And that we were under a
stealthy observation we all instinctively felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>It is annoying, putting aside the danger, and it
plays the devil by the nerves. To wake up in the
morning with the feeling that your actions that day
will have mysterious eyes upon them, governed and
directed with an inscrutable and determined will, ah!
it makes one pray for an open enemy. The tension
was telling upon us; on me probably least of all,
since I had the nerves of a steeplechase rider, and
fresh air and exercise kept me fit. But I felt things
could not go on indefinitely as they were. As the
days and weeks wore on, Rallenstein would scarcely be
likely to rest content with merely keeping his marked-down
quarry under observation. Our staying on at
Schönval was simply waiting for the assassin&rsquo;s stroke
that was being prepared. One side or other must
force the situation. I therefore determined that we
should risk it; but, as it turned out, the forcing came
from the other side.</p>

<p>I was walking near the village one afternoon, turning
over certain plans in my mind, when I made a singular
discovery. I ought to mention that the neighbourhood
was rich in geological treasures. There had
been, years before, a landslip, by which many hidden
things of past ages had been brought to light. I had
several times climbed about this region, more to
explore its picturesque ruggedness than for any
geological curiosity I possessed. On this day something
prompted me to go through the landslip again.
So I turned up the path behind the inn, which led
along a wooded ascent to where the fissured rocks and
tree-grown boulders lay in romantic confusion. At
one point in the irregular acclivity there was placed
at some twenty yards from the path an ancient stone
sarcophagus, which had been unearthed at some time,
and, its value being probably deemed less than the
cost of removal, had been left there to form one of the
attractions of the place, and, indirectly, of the inn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>below. I had passed this before, but had never taken
the trouble to turn off the path in order to examine it
more closely. The present and future had been too
absorbing to let one care about the past. But now I
did so. I stepped aside and strolled slowly towards
the object of my curiosity. As I approached, to my
astonishment a head appeared above the edge of the
stone coffer, and a girl&rsquo;s laughing face turned a sort
of petulant inquiry towards me. Saturated as I was
with mistrust, I hardly knew whether to be suspicious
of this apparition or not. A village girl, perhaps, I
thought, although she certainly did not look it. I
resolved to find out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said in German. &ldquo;I am
sorry to have disturbed you, but I was about to
examine this old object, not thinking any one was
inside it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile deepened into a laugh. &ldquo;How should
you?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is the last place you would
expect to find at least a living person in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was German scholar enough to know that it was
not her native tongue. She spoke it prettily, indeed,
but ungrammatically, and with a foreign accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t disturb you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Another day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had risen, stepped on to the ledge of the great
coffin, and now jumped down on the ground beside me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! I won&rsquo;t disturb your scientific studies,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;You are English, are you not?&rdquo; she
added, in our language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am. Like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly a guess. You could scarcely be anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my bad German, or something worse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your good English.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And my bad style?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at her as she sat on the edge of the sarcophagus,
kicking her feet to and fro and keeping her
eyes quizzically on me. She seemed about nineteen;
her manner rather older than that. It was sharp,
and had a suggestion of a woman of the world. On
the other hand, she was dressed quite girlishly; her
skirt was short, she had on a simple straw hat with
little trimming, and wore no ornaments save a plain
gold bar fastening her collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not going to let me frighten you
away,&rdquo; she said roguishly. &ldquo;I can easily find a more
comfortable seat, and science must be before everything,
as I know to my cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot plead guilty to the charge of being
scientific.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a comfort. Why, then, do you want to
examine this stupid old coffin? Curiosity, eh? All
tourists are so curious. They will go miles to see a
thing abroad they would not cross the road to look
at at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say that my curiosity has not been
rewarded. Although not quite satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like, if not asking too much, to know
what made you choose that gruesome relic for a
resting-place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me queerly and laughed. &ldquo;Your
curiosity shall be satisfied. In the first place, it is
more comfortable than it looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered a little at that, but did not say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second place it is novel, in the third it is
cool, and in the fourth it is a wholesome reminder,
what I suppose you would call a <i>memento mori</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice had changed so with the unexpected conclusion
that I looked up at her sharply. The roguery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>was now only flickering about her face, which was
almost sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Memento mori!</i> Why, what have you to do with
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more, perhaps, than the rest of the world. I
might not have thought of it but for this.&rdquo; She
tapped the sarcophagus. &ldquo;But life is uncertain
enough for us all, and&mdash;perhaps it was a fancy as I
lay there to imagine myself in the place of him or
her who occupied it hundreds, or, as my father will
tell me, thousands of years ago; and then to think
of a day that is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had never before heard a girl talk like that, and
no doubt my face showed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she continued, changing her tone, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
enough of the doleful for one day. Now tell me;
are you staying here? At the inn? No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. With friends. Are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, my father and I, are staying at Eisenhalm,
about four miles off. We came over here to hammer
at the landslip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I confess I was fairly puzzled by this girl,
and could not make up my mind whether to be suspicious
of her or not. I thought I would wait and
see what the father was like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father is scientific; a geologist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather. I have been brought up on fossils and
pliocene fragments. You can hardly wonder at my
taking naturally to this stone coffin as a summer-house,&rdquo;
she said wistfully. &ldquo;Science is very interesting
and absorbing to a man who takes to it, but it is
a horrible bore for his family. I am very, very dull,
and my feelings towards this landslip are not fit to be
expressed. Of course you have heard of my father,
Professor Seemarsh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recognized the name as one I had often seen in
the papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know your father well by repute. He
lectures at the Royal Institution, does he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you have heard him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed to say no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ashamed. You may be a very creditable
member of society and yet take no interest in old
bones and old stones. Father is an authority on the
flint age. A boy once broke his study window with a
stone, and he was delighted. It was a paleolithic
remainder. Nothing modern interests him in the
very least. A knife and fork of to-day are to him an
impertinence. Don&rsquo;t you pity me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the daughter of so celebrated a man to be
pitied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I suppose that&rsquo;s what every one thinks.
And I do so want to move on from this stupid place,
and there&rsquo;s no chance of it, because father has lighted
on an interesting cleavage and suspects flint remains.
Five o&rsquo;clock! He shall not grub any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me an off-hand nod, and moved away
towards the landslip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come with you?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I should
like to see Professor Seemarsh at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no objection, so we strolled on together,
chatting on indifferent subjects. I fancy our talk
was intermittent; anyhow, I know I was preoccupied
with turning over in my mind the possibilities of this
strange meeting. It was, in a way, natural enough;
and yet something seemed to put me on my guard.
That was due to the occurrences of the past fortnight
and the danger we were hourly expecting to show
itself. Had it not been for these circumstances, I
told myself, the meeting with this extraordinary girl
would have been simply one of the queer episodes
with which travel abounds.</p>

<p>We had not far to go. Fifty yards or so from the
entrance to the landslip I heard the tapping of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>hammer, guided by which I looked up and saw a man
on his knees busily at work, and my companion sang
out, &ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock, my flinty-hearted parent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Seemarsh turned round, gave an answering
wave of the hand, proceeding to collect his specimens
into a canvas satchel which he slung on his
shoulder, and then clambered down from the ledge
on the fissured rock.</p>

<p>I had told Miss Seemarsh my name, and she introduced
us. Naturally, I took keen notice of the Professor.
He was a learned-looking, untidy man of
about fifty-five, with shaggy grey eyebrows and
whitish hair, while his scrubby moustache and wisps
of shaggy beard showed a lofty disregard for grooming.
There was nothing remarkable in his face, except
that behind his tinted spectacles the eyes seemed keen
and restless. His dress was quite professional in its
negligent absence of taste. A light tweed Norfolk
jacket, a crumpled buff waistcoat, dark grey trousers,
and a weather-beaten soft felt hat were all in accordance
with the best traditions of science.</p>

<p>He bowed and shook hands jerkily, after the manner
of men whose pursuits absorb them from society. He
had a quick, short manner of speech as one who wishes
to say what is necessary as soon as possible and then
get to his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are staying here? At the inn? Wretched
place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I know. House on the site of the old castle.
Must have been an interesting place. Ruins still
exist, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; very fragmentary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;I am used to fragments. They tell
me all I want to know; though a mere sight-seer
wants something more. You are scientific?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>He drew in his breath sharply in pitying disappointment.
&ldquo;Uth! Well, you don&rsquo;t know what you
miss. Most fascinating this sort of thing.&rdquo; He waved
his hand comprehensively towards the rocks.</p>

<p>From behind him his daughter made a grimace at
me.</p>

<p>To save a smile, I hoped politely he had had a
good day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fair. But I am only on the outer crust as
yet. The great fascination of my work is that one
never knows when one may not come upon a unique
find. These,&rdquo; he took up a handful of fragments
from his bag, &ldquo;these are interesting, but they tell us
nothing we did not know before. That,&rdquo; he tapped a
piece with his finger nail, &ldquo;is tertiary. That&rsquo;s
curious, the indentation was certainly made ten
thousand years ago. Yes. I hope to come upon
something better in a day or two.&rdquo; He threw them
back, and buckled the satchel. I had never heard
any one talk so fast and jerkily. It seemed as though
all the words of each short sentence rushed out of his
mouth at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must say good-day. We
have a long walk before us. My daughter has probably
told you she is not geological. But being all day
in the fresh air has set her up wonderfully. Perhaps,
if you are staying on here, we may meet again, and I
may be privileged to try and bring you under the spell
of science. By the way, are the ruins of the old
castle shown to strangers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather an awkward question for me to answer
without appearing churlish. I could hardly treat
this man as a stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My host, Herr von Lindheim, is very ill just now,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;but I am sure he would be glad for you to
see them. Perhaps in a few days when he is better.
But there is really scarcely anything of interest to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>The Professor smiled. &ldquo;Anyhow, my work will be
here for some time to come. If I am disappointed in
this, perhaps I may remind you of your kind words.
The comparatively modern antique is so fast disappearing
that one likes to see it while one can. Goodbye.
Come, Gertrude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook hands and went off. The girl, who had
not spoken a word for some time, came up and gave
me her hand in a shy manner, which was rather contradicted
by a laugh in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let father make you a geologist,&rdquo; she said
archly. &ldquo;There are quite enough of them in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for a word from me, she
turned and ran after the Professor, linked her arm in
his, and so they went off down the winding path.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PROFESSOR IS MAIMED</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> back and told my friends of the afternoon&rsquo;s
incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must confess to feeling a little doubtful about
them,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make the girl out at all;
she is a most queer young woman, but of course Professor
Seemarsh is a well-known man in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure you have heard of him?&rdquo; Szalay
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I know the name well. After all, it is
quite likely that he would be grubbing about here for
specimens. These scientific fellows know of every
likely place in Europe for a find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A day or two passed, and I saw no more of my new
acquaintances, for the reason that I did not walk that
way. Miss Seemarsh, it is true, rather provoked my
curiosity by her strangeness, but not sufficiently to
induce me to run after her. We had noticed nothing
suspicious since the episode of poor Fritz, and the
strain of apprehending the enemy&rsquo;s next move was
rather trying. One afternoon I thought I would
stroll down to the landslip and see if the Professor
and his daughter were there. Action of some sort
seemed absolutely necessary to keep one&rsquo;s nerves in
order; although we had determined to make a dash
within the next few days.</p>

<p>I had gone but a very short way towards the village
when I saw coming towards me the pair whom I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>going to seek. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is suspicious.
What are they doing up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they drew near I noticed that the Professor
carried his arm in a sling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad we have met you,&rdquo; Miss Seemarsh
exclaimed as we greeted each other. &ldquo;My father
has met with an accident. Tumbled over one of his
beloved rocks yesterday, cut his hand and sprained
his wrist. So he cannot quarry in the landslip, poor
dear. And as he absolutely refuses to lose a day and
be idle, we were coming up to ask if we might see the
ruins of the old castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The request could hardly be refused, and we turned
back together, in spite of a remonstrance on the
Professor&rsquo;s part that he was spoiling my walk, and that
he could see all he wished without dragging me back.
But it need hardly be said, I was not likely to fall in
with that suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My work,&rdquo; the Professor said, in his quick jerky
way, &ldquo;is not by any means the easy-going business
most people think it. I am sometimes hanging in a
cradle for hours over a chasm perhaps a thousand feet
deep. The best places for finds are often the sides of a
perpendicular wall, which can only be reached by a
rope above. The worst bit of this slip is comparatively
child&rsquo;s play, although not free from a degree of danger,
as I have proved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We soon reached the house and had the Professor
at work on the walls of the old castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very interesting remains, very interesting,&rdquo; he
commented. &ldquo;Of course your friend has a history
of the old place? Yes? I should like to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These fragments do not tell you much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything, up to a certain point. But scarcely
the names and deeds of the early inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the inspection was over, and there was not
much to see, it seemed to me the height of inhospitality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>not to show some little civility to my own country
folk. They had walked all the way from Eisenhalm,
and were going to walk back. One could hardly
omit to ask them to come in and rest; as for the
danger, my suspicions, vague enough, were fast
evaporating. When I asked them to come indoors,
the Professor rather demurred. &ldquo;Your friend is ill,
you say. We had better not disturb him. Some
other day, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I felt constrained to press the invitation, and
the Professor yielded. The usual elaborate German
tea was brought in, and I left the room to tell Von
Lindheim of my visitors. He looked rather disquieted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all right,&rdquo; I assured him. &ldquo;He is a
well-known English savant, as I told you. And after
all, supposing he is not, what can these two do against
us. Come in. It will amuse you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came in. The Professor sympathetically inquired
as to his health, and we sat for a good while
chatting over our tea. Some of the Schönvalhof
archives were produced to gratify our visitors&rsquo; interest
in the place. Miss Seemarsh asked all sorts of questions;
how we liked being buried in the country, if
we did not have many visitors to keep us in touch
with the outer world, and how long we proposed to
stay before returning to Buyda. All these very natural
questions were interspersed with naïve comments
and comparisons between such a life and that of a
London savant of many engagements and an unquenchable
thirst for investigation.</p>

<p>Suddenly something appeared to have gone wrong
with the Professor&rsquo;s injured hand. He made an
expression of pain, saying his wound had been
troubling him for some little time. His daughter was
full of a somewhat rueful solicitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do wish it would get well quickly,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>half murmured to me. &ldquo;It is a trial when father can&rsquo;t
work. I would far rather it had been my own hand.
Father, hadn&rsquo;t you better let me dress it for you again?
I have brought the ointment and the bandages in my
pocket.&rdquo; She pulled out a little parcel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we might ask to have a little warm water
taken into a dressing-room, Gertrude might make
things more comfortable for me,&rdquo; her father said,
holding the arm as though in pain.</p>

<p>I jumped up and said I would see to it myself. So
accustomed to suspicion was I that my watch over
my friends had become almost automatic.</p>

<p>I led the way to a chamber, with a balcony commanding
a lovely view across the valley.</p>

<p>I left them and waited in the hall till they should
come down. After a while it struck me that it would,
perhaps, be as well to warn Szalay that the strangers
were near him. His room, where he spent most of
his time, adjoined Von Lindheim&rsquo;s. We had done
all we could to prevent his presence in the house being
known to any one outside it, and I thought it just as
well that he should keep close and not be seen even
by these English people, who might be questioned by
Rallenstein&rsquo;s spies.</p>

<p>So I ran quickly upstairs. When I reached the
corridor leading to the principal bedrooms, I was
rather surprised to see the door of the room in which I
had left the Seemarshes standing half-open. I knocked.
No answer, I looked in; the room was empty. I
went out to the head of the stairs; they were not to
be seen. As I hurried along the corridor in search
of them they came quickly round a corner and met
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there you are,&rdquo; cried the Professor. &ldquo;You
can guide us back. We mistook the turning to the
stairs and lost our way. What a labyrinth this house
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>It was not quite easy to see how the way downstairs
could have been missed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are easier?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, the fomentation and re-dressing have
done wonders. It pains me very little now. I shall
even hope to be at work on the slip again to-morrow.
Will you come and learn the rudiments of a delightful
science? It is all I have to offer in return for your
kindness, but to me it is much, and I think I dare
promise to interest you. No, thank you, we can
stay no longer. We have already trespassed too
much on your friend&rsquo;s hospitality. Now, shall we
see you on the rocks to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do come,&rdquo; the girl urged, and, more from
curiosity than anything else, I promised.</p>

<p class="ph3">A LESSON IN GEOLOGY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day was an eventful one. Its horrors come
vividly back to me in writing of it. The curiosity
which took me down to the rocks to learn a smattering
of geology was at least completely satisfied, and in a
way which in my most distrustful moods I little dreamt
of. In a very open state of mind, I went off to the
rocks. I can hardly tell my reasons, but, intuitively
perhaps, I was rather more suspicious of the geologist
and his daughter than I thought well to acknowledge
to my friends. I kept telling myself that it was
absurd.</p>

<p>Here was a well-known English geologist taking a
hard-working holiday after the manner of his kind.
And yet&mdash;the vague and unaccountable doubt in my
mind pricked on my curiosity, and made me impatient
to exercise my penetration in resolving the
doubt into certainty one way or other.</p>

<p>I came upon Miss Seemarsh sitting in a sheltered
cleft of the rocks high above the path, reading a
yellow-back novel. She gave me a free and easy nod.
&ldquo;You will find my father a little way on,&rdquo; she shouted,
&ldquo;in the next opening, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked her and went on. There was no difficulty
in finding the Professor, who was kneeling on an
overhanging platform of rock, hard at work. I
clambered up beside him and congratulated him on
his evident recovery from the effects of his accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Still a little stiff and painful,&rdquo; he jerked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>&ldquo;but my holiday is drawing to a close, and I cannot
afford to lose more time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must not let me interrupt you,&rdquo; was
my natural response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are not in the way, my dear sir. In fact
you can, if you will, be of help to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied that I should be delighted if he would
only show me how.</p>

<p>He took up a fragment of rock. &ldquo;You see these
streaks, those veins? They indicate tertiary fossils.
If you will hammer off some pieces and just put aside
all those that have a similar marking I shall be glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, as I expressed my readiness,
&ldquo;let me put you on to a likely place. There
is not much use in our both working together; besides,
it is dangerous, as chips fly off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly he took me across to another group of
rocks, where, after we had ascended a steep path, he
set me to work on an overhanging shelf of the cliff.
The wielding of a geologist&rsquo;s hammer, when one is
not especially keen on the science, is apt after awhile
to become a source of fatigue and boredom. I soon
got pretty tired of my work, particularly as I came
across nothing that looked at all interesting. However,
I stuck to it mechanically. At the same time,
it was not what I bargained for; I was learning
nothing of geology, since the man who might have
instructed me was some hundred and fifty yards away;
consequently, there was not a great distinction between
my occupation and that of a breaker of stones
on the roadside&mdash;a proverbially unexciting employment.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my work was not so absorbing but that
my mind had room for other thoughts. Presently,
in the midst of my hammering, it occurred to me&mdash;what
if this setting me at stone-cracking should be
but a trick to get me out of the way, and so leave the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>two men at Schönvalhof defenceless? At the bare
thought, I threw down my hammer, and had already
run a considerable way down the sloping shelf, when
the idea succeeded that I ran the risk of making a fool
of myself. I stopped and listened. The sharp tap
of the Professor&rsquo;s hammer from beyond the next
bluff reassured me. About to return to my task, I just
stayed to listen to the hammer&rsquo;s fall once more.
What I heard though, was a great dull thud, followed
by a crackling noise from the rock high above where
I was standing. Then a terrific crash, as a great
boulder came bounding down the rocky ledge towards
me.</p>

<p>My situation was of course absolutely frightful.
Escape was out of the question, with a wall of rock
on one hand, sheer precipice on the other, and death,
in the shape of tons of rock, crashing down the path
to sweep me into eternity. Happily, the whole
occurrence was so momentary that I had hardly time
to realize my awful danger before it was past.</p>

<p>The great rushing mass was just upon me, when
something, perhaps a projection from the rock or an
unevenness in the path, gave it a slight outward bias.
The result was, that before it came to me its course
had begun to trend away from the wall; as it reached
me, it was half over the edge on the other side, leaving
a gap in which I stood unharmed; next instant it
had overbalanced and gone down into the chasm,
the noise of its fall reverberating in and out of the
cliffs like thunder.</p>

<p>I can remember standing there leaning against the
rock half-dazed with the shock of my danger, for the
moment hardly realizing it and my miraculous escape.
When I had pulled myself together and could look
round, a great gap in the piled-up rock above where I
had been working showed me whence the mass had
been dislodged. My sudden suspicion and panic had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>saved me, for had I remained up there I must have
been crushed. Indeed, had I been surprised a couple
of paces higher up the path it would have been all
over with me.</p>

<p>I now made all haste to leave the dangerous spot;
scrambled down to the ravine below, passed what
came so near being the engine of my death, the huge
boulder now resting peacefully enough on the bed of
the chasm, and so round the next corner of the rock in
search of the Professor. It was rather surprising to
me that I had not already seen him or his daughter
hurrying to ascertain the result of the fall, which
they must have heard. As I came out of the comparatively
open space in front of the ridge, my surprise
was increased by the sight of the father and
daughter talking casually together. The Professor
was leaning in a careless attitude against a rock with
what looked like a smile on his face; the girl stood by
talking vehemently, it seemed, as I drew nearer,
and he,&mdash;yes, I was sure of it&mdash;he laughed. So
intent were they on whatever they were talking
about, that neither noticed me till I was within fifty
paces of them. It had further struck me as odd
when the Professor began carelessly to play with the
hammer, throwing it from one hand to the other in a
way that argued either great fortitude in a man
wounded as he professed to be, or an amazingly rapid
recovery.</p>

<p>With a start he became aware of my approach.
Even at that distance I could see that his face changed
curiously twice: once to an involuntary, then to what
I was sure was an assumed expression. Reading his
looks the girl turned; her face also was a puzzle;
startled at first, then relieved. The Professor dropped
his hammer and came forward with alacrity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Tyrrell,&rdquo; he exclaimed effusively,
&ldquo;glad to see you safe. That was a nasty fall, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>we hardly dared wonder whether you had escaped.
Heaven be thanked, it is all right, or I should never
have forgiven myself for putting you to work there.
But it seemed to me safe enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was scarcely in the mood to take his fluent, if
jerky, apologies in a very charitable spirit, particularly
as I seemed to detect an indication of disappointment
lurking beneath them; and my suspicion
was rather strengthened by a sort of confused shame
in the face of the girl, who said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not seem particularly anxious as to my
fate,&rdquo; I could not help remarking. &ldquo;But for my
providentially having moved from the place where
you set me to work I must have been killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Professor now looked grave and concerned
enough for anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut! Is it possible! I shall never cease to
regret having put you in such danger. I am so
very, very sorry. Believe me, I would have staked
my reputation against the chance of such an occurrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be a lesson to you, father,&rdquo; the girl
said in a low voice.</p>

<p>He gave a quick half-glance at her, and I caught
under his glasses an expression which was not exactly
remorseful. &ldquo;It will be indeed,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
shaking his head up and down. &ldquo;It is frightful to
think of what might have happened, my dear friend;
what a merciful escape!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; said I coldly, &ldquo;it has taught me a
lesson: not to run gratuitous risks, even in the name
of science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a mystery to me how that piece of cliff can
have come down,&rdquo; he said, rather obviously ignoring
my tone. &ldquo;Erosion would hardly account for it up
there, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out of all patience I cut him short. &ldquo;The scientific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>side does not interest me, and I take leave to doubt
whether, had you stood in my place, it would have
seemed of paramount importance to you. I fear
we are hardly likely to take the same view of the
affair, so I will wish you a good evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affair was perplexing enough; and the more
my vague suspicions of the Seemarshes advanced towards
certainty, the greater puzzle did it become.
But upon one thing I was resolved&mdash;to give them a
wide berth in future. My narrow escape was not to
be thought of without the irresistible suggestion of a
sinister design. I, however, determined to keep my
own counsel about it; Von Lindheim and Szalay
being nervous enough as it was. But neither the
Professor nor his daughter should be admitted into
the house again if I could help it.</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts as I made my way from
the rock valley to the village. The path, it will be
remembered, descended upon and led past the inn.
As I came round the corner of that house I happened,
by the merest chance, to glance in at the window of
the coffee-room. One man was in it, sitting half
turned from the light, reading a newspaper. That
casual glance sufficed for me to recognize him, then I
sprang forward out of sight as he was about to look
round.</p>

<p>It was Count Furello.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A BLOW IS STRUCK</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> not greatly surprised to find the Count in the
village. The question which exercised my mind for
the rest of the way to Schönvalhof was whether he had
any connexion with Professor Seemarsh. I should
have liked to have kept watch upon the wily Count,
only it seemed much more necessary to lose no time
in putting my friends on their guard, since the fellow&rsquo;s
presence could mean nothing but danger. Thinking
over the events of that afternoon I was half inclined to
acquit the Professor of any sinister intention. The
fall of rock might have been a pure accident, which
no one could have foreseen: such displacements are of
periodical occurrence, and chance had led me to the
spot at one of the critical moments when Nature&rsquo;s
alarum was set to strike.</p>

<p>As to the Professor&rsquo;s apparent callousness, why&mdash;perhaps
the conduct of hide-bound scientists was not
to be judged by that of other men. In the interests of
their pursuit they are inclined to hold life cheap, brute
or human, their own or any one else&rsquo;s. So I had still
an open mind as to the Professor when I reached the
house.</p>

<p>I told the men of my having seen Furello. They
did not show as much alarm as might have been
expected, having, perhaps, made up their minds to the
worst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is always a relief in an affair of this sort when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>our opponent shows his hand. Now that we are forewarned
we can take our measures accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we may look for a visit from the Count
any minute now,&rdquo; Von Lindheim observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what his excuse for a call will be?&rdquo; said
Szalay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Jaguar&rsquo;s emissaries need little excuse,&rdquo; the
other returned gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better leave <i>il Conte</i> to me,&rdquo; I suggested,
&ldquo;if he does call. You are too ill to receive him;
and I will do my best to throw dust in his eyes. It is
doubtful whether he knows that Szalay is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chancellor knows everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he does it shall not be our fault. This amiable
assassin will not see our friend if there is a hiding-place
in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We discussed our plan of defence, and then, feeling
a strong desire to keep watch upon the Count, I went
off again towards the village. Avoiding the road I
struck into a wooded path, keeping as much under
cover as possible. It was well that I did so. When
about half-way to the village I caught sight of a
well-known figure crossing a field. Furello. He
was walking fast, hurrying it seemed, and smoking
a cigar. From my screen within the fringe of a small
wood I had a full view of him without the risk of
being noticed. The ground he crossed was undulating.
He ran down the little hills, and once or twice halted
on the top of an ascent to look round. Presently,
when he had gone a safe distance, I came out of my
shelter and followed him. Knowing the country
probably better than he, I was able to keep him in
sight at no great distance, marking him from the
other side of a straggling hedge. Soon he came in
view of Von Lindheim&rsquo;s house, peeping out from the
trees on the hill above us. He stopped a few moments
looking at it, then glanced round, made a peculiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>gesture, perhaps of contempt, shaking his hand at the
house, and hurried on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going to the railway station,&rdquo; I said to
myself, and so it proved. Following him as closely
as I dared, I was in time to see him get into a train
and take his departure in the direction of Buyda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far good,&rdquo; I exclaimed, turning back. &ldquo;It is
as well I saw my gentleman off, or we should have
been worrying as to what had become of him. But
what has he been doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speculation on that head was manifestly futile.
The two men were relieved to hear of his departure,
although much exercised to know what agency he
had left behind him. We dined and made ourselves
as happy as our forebodings would allow. After dinner
we opened a packet of newspapers which had arrived,
and proceeded to post ourselves in the doings of the
outside world. I was deep in a week-old <i>Times</i>, when
a sudden exclamation from Von Lindheim made me
look up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyrrell!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,
does this mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; He read from the paper as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accident to an Englishman on the Alps. A party
of Englishmen were ascending the Weisshorn on
Tuesday last. While attempting to scale a difficult
peak, one of the party, who were roped together, lost
his footing, and, the rope being slack, the shock of his
fall was communicated with violence to the rest of his
companions. The whole party fell a considerable
distance, but happily were saved from going to
certain death by the strenuous exertions of their two
guides, Jean Koller and Barthelmy Reiss. One of
the party was the well-known Alpine climber, Professor
Seemarsh, of London, who sustained a broken
collar-bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Szalay and I had by a common impulse sprung to
our feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Seemarsh!&rdquo; I snatched the paper and
read the name for myself. &ldquo;There is only one
Professor Seemarsh. Then who is this man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Lindheim&rsquo;s answer was a hopeless shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday last we know that Professor Seemarsh,
the Alpine climber, or the man who calls
himself by that name, was here in this village, hundreds
of miles away from the Weisshorn. And whatever
injury he may or may not have received, it is
certainly not a broken collar-bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as I have suspected,&rdquo; Szalay said gloomily.</p>

<p>For some moments neither of us spoke. All my
suspicions now came back as certainties, and I could
properly appreciate the escape I had had that afternoon.
Von Lindheim laughed grimly. &ldquo;To think
that we have had the scoundrel in this very house.
It is a wonder I am yet alive. He did not come here
for nothing, you may swear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time will show, if we are only in a position to
comprehend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us at least be thankful,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that chance
has shown us our danger. We shall know our enemy
now when we see him. You are right, Lindheim,
about the Professor&rsquo;s accent. But we must confess
they played their parts well. The girl! What a
life! No wonder she occasionally breaks out into
cynical bitterness that is almost startling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reviewing the conduct of the <i>soi-disants</i> Seemarshes,
I now related how they had roused my suspicions
when they pretended to have missed their way upstairs.
Szalay, as he listened, looked uncomfortable,
almost terrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That accounts,&rdquo; said he blankly, &ldquo;for something
which happened yesterday, and which I could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>make out at the time. I was sitting in my room
reading when the door suddenly opened. Naturally,
I turned quickly to see who it was, but as I did so it
was shut quickly again, not so quickly, though, but
that I fancied I had caught a glimpse of a woman&rsquo;s
dress. Imagining it had been Frau Pabst I thought
little more of the matter, but now I know&mdash;it must
have been that girl spy, and my whereabouts is no
longer a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the sooner we make a move from here the
better,&rdquo; said Von Lindheim. &ldquo;It is sheer madness
to stay waiting the assassin&rsquo;s blow. To-morrow
morning&mdash;Tyrrell, will you come with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I would. We sat up late arranging our
plans and making preparations for our journey. Our
idea was to make, at all hazards, a rush for the frontier.
The plan at the best was full of danger, but at least
it was no worse than staying where we were, marked
down by these secret enemies. Anyhow, it meant
action, relief from the strain of suspense, which was
becoming intolerable.</p>

<p>So we laid our plans for the morrow, little dreaming
with all our apprehensions what the night would
bring forth.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when we turned in, having
had much to do in preparing for an early setting out
to run the gauntlet of Rallenstein&rsquo;s myrmidons.
Exciting as the day&rsquo;s events had been, I lay but a
short time, being pretty tired, before going off into a
sound sleep; to be awoke with a start, having a confused
idea of a cry in my ears. It was just growing
light. Hardly had I collected my faculties when the
cry rang again through the house, again and again,
kept up in a series of screams of terror. I sprang out
of bed, snatching up my revolver. Before I could
reach the door I heard Von Lindheim&rsquo;s voice calling
my name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Shouting &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; I dashed along the passage
to his room, which was divided only by a small
dressing-room from Szalay&rsquo;s. I met Von Lindheim at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>He was in a terrible state of excitement. &ldquo;Szalay,&rdquo;
was all he could gasp. &ldquo;Take me away before I go
mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor fellow, I could see, was beside himself with
something worse than fear. A strange noise came
from Szalay&rsquo;s room, a horrible, inarticulate sound of
a man struggling, as it were, to call out something.
Thinking he was being strangled, I rushed in with my
revolver ready.</p>

<p>To my astonishment he was alone, standing in the
middle of the room, but so horribly altered that I
hardly recognized him as the same man to whom I
had bidden good-night a few hours before. His face
was distorted, its colour changed, the sanguine,
ruddy complexion being now a dark grey; the features
seemed bloated, and the eyes glared with almost
maniacal terror. The aspect of our poor friend was so
appalling that the sight seemed to take all the strength
from me as I stood before him under the thrill of this
hideous experience. I would far rather have found
the room full of armed cut-throats than containing
this solitary pitiable victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Szalay!&rdquo; I cried at length. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he tried to answer a spasm seemed to catch his
throat. He pointed with an unnatural, mad gesture
to the open window, trying to talk, but the power of
enunciation had failed him, he could produce only
inarticulate gibberish. He threw up his hands in
despair and shrieked again. I seemed to catch the
words, &ldquo;Dead man! Dead man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he rushed to the looking-glass. At the reflection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>of his face he recoiled with a scream, and
flung himself prone on the bed.</p>

<p>I went to the door and found Von Lindheim outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this fearful thing? What has happened
to him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I know no more than you,&rdquo;
he said in a frightened whisper. &ldquo;I heard him shriek,
rushed in and saw&rdquo;&mdash;he shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;what you have
seen. Those devils have got in and have done for
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw no one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But they will come. They are here, Tyrrell.
I am going to put a bullet through my brain. It is
better than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; I said, and went back into the
room.</p>

<p>Szalay was lying as I had left him. I spoke his
name, but he returned no answer, made no movement.
Nerving myself, I went up and lifted the outstretched
arm. It was heavy and lifeless. I felt for
the pulse; there was none. Then I went back to Von
Lindheim and told him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE JAGUAR&rsquo;S DEN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I spent</span> the ensuing hours in reasoning with Von Lindheim
against his panic, and endeavouring to instil
hope into him. Naturally, under circumstances
which would have shaken the strongest nerves, it
was not easy, but at length I succeeded in calming
him, and he seemed to take a sufficiently resolute
view of the situation to bring himself to discuss the
best plan for relieving it.</p>

<p>I now determined to postpone our flight for a day,
while I would go to Buyda, see the Chancellor, and
remonstrate with him, pointing out how unnecessary
and cruel these devilish precautions were.</p>

<p>Accordingly, having made Von Lindheim promise
to do nothing rash in my absence, I had a horse
saddled, and after an early breakfast rode off to
Buyda, choosing that mode of travel rather than the
railway, as being calculated to give any spies less
indication of a prolonged journey.</p>

<p>I have often wondered since at my temerity in
bearding the Jaguar in his den; but in those days I
was strong and confident; even the ghastly business
in the midst of which chance had thrown me had
hardly shaken my nerves, and then, again, I did not
imagine myself to be in such danger as the sequel
showed to be the case. The morning was fair and
bright after an early shower, and as I rode along with
a winding sparkling river below me on the one hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>and the dark blue masses of pine-clad hills on the other,
I could not help contrasting Nature&rsquo;s tranquil beauty
with the hideousness of man&rsquo;s cruelty. An old theme,
but one that appealed to me very strongly that
summer morning.</p>

<p>I arrived at Buyda before mid-day, and leaving my
horse at the hotel made my way straight to the
Chancellor&rsquo;s quarters in the palace. Having sent up
my name with a request to have an audience of him
on urgent business, a message was brought back that
his Excellency was with the King, but that he would
be happy to see me at a later hour in the afternoon.
So I went back to the hotel and lunched. Afterwards,
as I was preparing to go out for a stroll in the city to
kill time, a precautionary measure occurred to me,
which I proceeded to put into practice. I wrote
down certain particulars, sealed them in an envelope,
and then went to the office of the British Consul,
with whom I had already a slight acquaintance. He
was a very much bored man, for whom even the
pleasantest side of life in Buyda had ceased to have
any charm, and he was evidently, as a relief from the
monotony, glad to see me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to leave this letter with you, Mr.
Turnour,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t come back or send for
it before to-morrow morning, open it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will explain itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said rather anxiously, &ldquo;I
hope you are not going to do anything rash, run into
any danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed. &ldquo;I am not going to leave Buyda, if I
can help it, before I come back for that letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What danger should there be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None to a British subject,&rdquo; he answered guardedly.
&ldquo;All the same, queer things do happen sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the enlightened rule of Chancellor Rallenstein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked grave, and as though he would like to say
more to me than he dared. &ldquo;Rallenstein is a strong
man; one of the strongest brains in Europe, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
sank his voice&mdash;&ldquo;he is not credited with an excess
of scruples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I refrained from looking as though I could illustrate
that opinion in highly coloured fashion, and rose to
go. Turnour was a weak man&mdash;a good official, but a
machine. Certainly not the man to take into an
appalling confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of myself.
Only, a stranger in an out-of-the-way place like this is
easily lost sight of and never missed. I shall, no
doubt, come back for that letter to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He locked it in a drawer, and after a few commonplaces
I left him and went back through the city towards
the palace. The place was busy and gay as
usual; people get used to living under the very frown
of a despotic government as at the foot of a volcano.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed, I was ushered into Rallenstein&rsquo;s
presence. He received me with a smile which
might almost be called genial, and apologized for
having had to ask me to postpone my audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been in the country, Herr Tyrrell,
<i>nicht wahr</i>? You are looking well. Englishmen
thrive best away from town life.&rdquo; I wondered if
there was a covert meaning in that. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he
added pleasantly, &ldquo;how can I have the pleasure of
serving you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come from Herr von Lindheim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes?&rdquo; There was simply polite interest in
his look and tone. The heavy face gave no evil sign as
I spoke the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as an ambassador from him, but entirely on
my own initiative.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The tone was still polite, now almost
verging towards boredom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Von Lindheim,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is in fear of his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thick eyebrows rose incredulously. &ldquo;In fear of
his life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt the man&rsquo;s power of will and character, and
determined to stand up against it. &ldquo;And with
reason,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;Your Excellency will, I
am sure, not blame him for such a fancy when I tell
you that within the last few days two colleagues of
his have been secretly assassinated, and his own life
has been attempted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face I was watching gave an incredulous frown.
&ldquo;My dear Herr Tyrrell, this is an extraordinary and
astounding statement of yours. Two of Herr von
Lindheim&rsquo;s colleagues assassinated and his life attempted!
You can scarcely expect me to credit
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; I rejoined boldly, &ldquo;your Excellency
should know these facts better than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last a great gust swept over the mobile face.
&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; he demanded, with a
show of restrained displeasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only, that as both these gentlemen, these victims,
had the honour to be attached to your Excellency&rsquo;s
Bureau, you should be better informed of their fate
than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, naturally, well aware,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that
Herr d&rsquo;Urban was accidentally drowned the other
day while boating, but,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;it
can hardly be pretended that our service, advantageous
as I venture to claim it is, confers immortality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I returned his smile. &ldquo;Rather the reverse just
now, Herr Chancellor. The Secretary Szalay also has
died suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From natural causes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You suggest foul play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed indulgently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Herr Tyrrell, I have always given an
Englishman credit for being the incarnation of common
sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I am not less sensible than the average of
my countrymen. And that quality would certainly
lead me to the conclusion that foul play is at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed, still sneeringly indulgent. &ldquo;Perhaps
you can suggest a motive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply that these unfortunate men are supposed
to have knowledge of a dangerous secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows in contemptuous surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tyrrell, this is too absurd! You can hardly
suggest or expect me to entertain such an inference
seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a strange coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had studied our German philosophers you
would have ceased to find anything strange in mere
coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. It would need, however, a great deal
of philosophy to refute my theory of foul play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to understand the rampart of polite incredulity
behind which Rallenstein had entrenched
himself, and how hopeless it was for me either to
break through or entice him from it. Nevertheless, I
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that an attempt was made to
kill Herr von Lindheim by poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have proof?&rdquo; The question was put almost
carelessly, with just as much show of interest as politeness
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proof of my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not always the most trustworthy witnesses,&rdquo; he
observed, with his cynical smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;seems determined not
to be interested in what has happened. So be it. My
purpose in coming here to-day was to assure you of
Herr von Lindheim&rsquo;s loyalty, and to beg you to use
your authority to put a stop to the attempts against
his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would seem to imply, sir,&rdquo; he replied, stroking
his face with his hand, &ldquo;that these attempts which
you allege have a political motive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too ridiculous,&rdquo; he said, as though to himself.
&ldquo;My good sir, you have found a mare&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I leaned forward. &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; I said earnestly,
&ldquo;can we not come to an understanding? I make no
accusations, I seek to know nothing; my interference
is merely forced upon me by pity and a desire to clear
up a misunderstanding. I ask you to remove this
cloud of danger hanging over Herr von Lindheim&rsquo;s
head. You can do it if you will, and I can assure you
you will not repent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I thought my entreaty would move him I was
mistaken. I might as well have pleaded with the
bronze statue of a warrior king that stood in the corner
behind him. He waved me back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your appeal involves an accusation which I
utterly repudiate. You are a foreigner, Herr Tyrrell,
and therefore I have heard you with an indulgence
which your suggestion scarcely deserves. To ask
me to give a pledge against a chimerical danger is more
than absurd. I do not wish to make use of strong
language, or I might point out in such that the object
of your visit might easily be construed into a flagrant
insult to his Majesty whose humble adviser I have
the honour to be. If I might offer you a word of
advice, it would be that so long as you choose to avail
yourself of the hospitality of this country you should
devote your time to sport or pleasure, and avoid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>mixing yourself up in affairs which do not concern you.
Even were this monstrous suggestion of yours in any
way true, the interference of an outsider could serve
no tangible end. You will do well to consider your
position in the light of that common sense which
is, I believe, the birthright of most Englishmen. That
is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rose. &ldquo;I have then no comforting assurance to
take Herr von Lindheim, Excellency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr von Lindheim&rsquo;s life is in no more danger
than your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Delphic pronouncement truly! &ldquo;I have no
fear of that,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he rejoined, fox-like, &ldquo;if your veiled
accusations were correct, you might stand in some
danger yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech was tentative. I saw that, and determined
not to be led into any admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no fear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and can take care of
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a bold man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. And I understood better than ever
why he was called the Jaguar. Though the flesh of
the lower part of his face was loose and mobile, the
skin over his forehead was drawn tight, his eyes were
feline, and the lines of his mouth cruel. But when it
suited him to put on a pleasant expression the stealthy
cruelty of the face in a measure disappeared. Now
there was the look it had worn glaring through
the window at that fatal marriage, the look that had
bent over the murdered bridegroom&rsquo;s face. But I
maintained my dogged resolve not to be overawed by
the man or the devil within him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My confidence in coming here,&rdquo; I answered coolly,
&ldquo;is due less to courage than the fact that I have left
a letter, containing word of my intention, together
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>with several other pertinent matters, in the hands of a
friend whom I can trust, and who will open it at a
certain hour unless I am there to prevent him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My words amounted almost to a threat, at least,
to a defiance, and the look they called up into his
Excellency&rsquo;s eyes was not a pleasant one. But he
showed no other sign of annoyance; on the contrary,
his next words were almost jocular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust, Herr Tyrrell, that you will take great care
to avoid all accidents. For if anything should unfortunately
happen to you while we have the honour
to include you among our country&rsquo;s guests, I take it
that the responsibility&mdash;or worse&mdash;of such misfortune
would be laid at our door. So I do hope you will
take care of yourself, my dear Herr Tyrrell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; I replied, bowing, and moving
towards the door. I turned as he spoke again. The
man looked genial enough now; the evil print on the
face was smoothed over, the lines of cunning no longer
made the rest stand out in relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so far as your friend&rsquo;s fears are concerned,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you may take him my assurance that they
are groundless. Herr von Lindheim is doubtless out
of health, his nerves are unstrung. He needs a
holiday; he may take one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your assurance, Excellency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my assurance. I trust you will both
be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He half rose to return my bow, smiling, though it
seemed, from my last glance, that the smile was
growing more feline and sinister. There was no more
to be hoped for or said, and I left him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A WORD OF WARNING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I walked</span> along the Königstrasse, the principal street
of Buyda, reflecting on my interview, and wondering
how far I could trust the assurance of the Chancellor&rsquo;s
last words. His was one of those complex characters,
so hopelessly difficult to understand, that I felt it an
even chance whether his word was to be trusted or
disbelieved.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I persuaded myself that my visit had done
no harm, and there was just the likelihood that his
purpose might relax with regard to Von Lindheim.
How far I was justified in this idea the sequel will
show. But chance certainly made the journey to
Buyda one of the most momentous of my life.</p>

<p>My reflections were interrupted by a man who came
quickly up from behind, touched his hat and addressed
me. A man in livery. He said that the
Baroness Fornbach would like to speak to me. She
was in her carriage a few yards down on the other
side of the street. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I
followed the man. If I had my doubts and suspicions
about the Baroness I was yet somewhat inclined,
remembering her half confidences on the evening I
had supped with her, to try whether I could get any
information from her about the Chancellor. At the
same time I resolved to walk warily.</p>

<p>The Baroness gave me a friendly greeting, asked
as to my plans, where I had been, how long my stay
in Buyda was to last, and on learning of my immediate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>departure insisted on my accompanying her home for
a cup of tea. As there was not much chance of
my learning anything important in the open street
and in the presence of a lady who was with her, I
accepted the invitation and got into the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for tea, but shall be delighted to
have half an hour&rsquo;s chat with you,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well. I know you English are faddy about
spoiling your dinners,&rdquo; she returned with a laugh as
we drove off.</p>

<p>After tea the Baroness&rsquo;s companion disappeared,
and I was free to begin my questions. As to whether
they would be satisfactorily answered or not I was
doubtful, but anyhow I would make the attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am interested and puzzled by the fate of that
poor fellow Von Orsova, whom I was to have met
the very evening of his death. Can you throw any
light upon it, Baroness? In the country one hears
nothing but bare facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Affecting to speak more or less carelessly I was
watching her narrowly, and saw that at my question
she &ldquo;clinched&rdquo; a little. All that was meant for me
to see, however, was a shrug as she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows? No one precisely. But we all
guess. A love affair is the most natural solution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;My dear Herr Tyrrell, you know
as much as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Baroness, if you choose to play the
Sphinx&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is safest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not trust me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled, this time a little bitterly. &ldquo;I have long
ago ceased to trust anybody. But, really, and truly,
I know no more than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed. &ldquo;You shall not tell me a word more than
you wish, only&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are as curious as a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious? No. My feeling was more serious
than that. Let me tell you our friend Von Lindheim
is concerned at the deaths that have occurred among
the staff of the Chancellerie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally. They were friends of his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only that. He fears a like fate may strike
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His nerves are upset. He has been ill, has he
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is lucky to have been no worse,&rdquo; I said
cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never imbued you with his fears?&rdquo; she
asked in a tone of raillery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for myself, but for him. I have seen the
Chancellor to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought I, watching her, &ldquo;that is no news
to you. He assures me,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that Von
Lindheim&rsquo;s fears are groundless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Then you are satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I leant forward. &ldquo;Baroness, tell me frankly. Do
you think I may be satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lay back, and took up a small fan from the table
at her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell? Why do you ask me? Can I
guarantee his Excellency&rsquo;s word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be my friend in this place where I have
no friends, and advise me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A peculiar expression came over her face, a look
that I cannot describe, a look of inexpressible bitterness
and regret, struggling as it were to get through
the mask which her part obliged her to wear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Baroness,&rdquo; I said significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I am always your friend,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as a friend your advice is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none to give&mdash;on that subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked swiftly, almost fearfully, round the
room. She was holding the little black fan&mdash;I see
her now&mdash;tightly in her clenched hands. She threw it
down, and clasped her hands over her knees, leaning
forward and speaking in her usual tone, but as low as a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My advice to you, Herr Tyrrell, is to leave this
country. You may be safe as yet. But you have
been ill-advised in interesting yourself in other men&rsquo;s
affairs. We are under an iron will here, and it makes
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brought me here to tell me that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my intense surprise her eyes filled with tears.
She looked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me that, don&rsquo;t ask me that,&rdquo; she returned
passionately, but always in a low voice. &ldquo;Be
thankful that you are free to go, and pity us who are
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her handkerchief to her eyes. I rose, and
stood leaning my elbow on the mantelpiece. There
was silence; a little clock by me chimed six. Then I
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have asked you a distressing question.
The more that it was perhaps unnecessary.
For I know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose quickly, stopping me by a gesture of her
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me! Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; she cried under
her breath. &ldquo;Say you know nothing. Your life may
depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baroness!&rdquo; I cried, almost appalled as I realized
the truth of her position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you,&rdquo; she went on with the same vehemence,
intensified by the restraint she put upon her
voice, &ldquo;for I know you can be staunch and true;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>you are as far above all the tricks and treachery in
which we live here as heaven from hell&mdash;I trust you,
Englishman, with my life. Yes. For if it were
known that I had spoken to you like this I should
share the fate of Asta von Winterstein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started. &ldquo;Asta von Winterstein?&rdquo; Of course
I remembered the girl, the favourite Maid of Honour
to the Princess, and my fascinating partner at the
State ball. She, naturally, had been in the secret,
and when I recalled that lovely animated face, the
girl&rsquo;s merry laugh and overflowing spirits, I shuddered.
&ldquo;Has anything happened to her?&rdquo; I scarcely
dared put the question.</p>

<p>The Baroness looked at me in surprise. She was
quite herself now, and spoke with her usual calm.
&ldquo;Have you not heard? It was in the papers. Fräulein
von Winterstein was returning after dark from
an excursion to Salenberg. The coachman missed
his way, and overturned the carriage in the narrow
pass above the river. It fell down the steep side into
the water. The driver threw himself off the box
and escaped by a miracle, but poor Asta went to her
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tone was quite impassive, as she would have
related the occurrence at a dinner party. I felt a
sensation almost of horror at the deliberate methods
of this man-tiger, Rallenstein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible! Horrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the poor girl&rsquo;s body has not yet been
recovered,&rdquo; she continued with the same repression of
all feeling which I could well understand and sympathize
with. &ldquo;The river is deep and swift in that
gorge, and she may have been carried down for miles.
Her mother is almost distracted, her father, General
von Winterstein, is abroad, and the news will hardly
have reached him. Poor man! He can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke the last words she looked at me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>significantly. We understood each other. No more
was needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may trust me,&rdquo; I said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Her hand touched mine. I was about to raise it
to my lips when she snatched it away. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
she murmured warningly.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the other lady came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count Furello is here, my dear. I thought I
would tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The announcement was made in such a curious
manner that I turned inquiringly to the Baroness.
She gave just the suggestion of a shake of the head,
and I barely caught the whisper, &ldquo;Go, as soon as
you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next moment the Count was shown in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE FAN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count Furello</span> came in with a bow, then, advancing,
bent low over the Baroness&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a surprise, Count,&rdquo; she said, quite herself
again. &ldquo;We heard you were away from Buyda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been travelling, and am here only till to-morrow.
But I could not pass through without paying
my respects to the Baroness Fornbach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he spoke the tightly stretched lips drew away,
leaving the abnormally white teeth bare. He was
most polite, but not pretty.</p>

<p>He then turned and bowed ceremoniously to me,
apparently quite aware of my presence, although he
had not seemed to look in my direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are still in Buyda, Mr. Tyrrell. We had an
idea you had left us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a time,&rdquo; I replied lightly. &ldquo;As becomes
a wandering devotee of sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sport! And you leave England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! like so many of your countrymen you are
hard to satisfy. You would rather go far and fare
worse than stay at home. Well, enterprise at the
possible expense of comfort is admirable. Dare one
conclude that our city here temporarily pleases you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him sharply, uncertain whether his
speech was mere polite small-talk or covert sarcasm.
Not that I cared, except so far as it interested me to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>note the various phases of the man&rsquo;s character. The
peculiar expression of his face made a perfect mask,
far harder to see through even than Rallenstein&rsquo;s
impassiveness. There was, perhaps, the gleam of a
sneer in the eyes&mdash;those unruly tell-tales, ever ready
to contradict our words and betray us. But I was
not certain, and answered simply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I enjoyed a few weeks&rsquo; sojourn in Buyda
extremely. For the last week or two I have been
staying a short way out in the country with a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Count Furello bowed in acknowledgment, as it were,
of a piece of information which did not interest him
deeply enough for words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not come, then, from the Geierthal,
Count?&rdquo; the Baroness inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I have been travelling. I hope to return
home to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Travelling! On the devil&rsquo;s business, indeed.</p>

<p>The Baroness turned to me. &ldquo;Count Furello has a
most picturesque home, an ancient Monastery on an
island, and in most lovely country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The teeth gleamed. &ldquo;Scarcely on an island,
<i>gnädige Baronin</i>,&rdquo; he objected deferentially, &ldquo;although
practically it is so. The moat surrounding the
Monastery has overflowed and enlarged itself to such
an extent that the building seems to stand on an island
in the midst of a lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very charming spot,&rdquo; the other lady observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it far from here?&rdquo; I asked, affecting less interest
than I felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About forty miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rose to take my leave. The Baroness gave me a
little significant pressure of the hand, which I understood
and returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be charmed to show Herr Tyrrell the
hospitality of the Geierthal, and to afford him a few
days&rsquo; sport,&rdquo; the Count said, a little stiffly and half-heartedly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span> it seemed, for the man of such exuberant politeness.
&ldquo;We shall have a fair amount of game;
but unfortunately just now I am only at home for a
day on the business of my estate. If Herr Tyrrell
could honour me in perhaps a month or two&rsquo;s time, it
would be all that I could wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I shall have resumed my travels,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;If I had been going to make a longer stay in your
country, I should have been delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret,&rdquo; said he, bowing again, &ldquo;that my enforced
absence from home deprives me of so great a
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His manner was becoming almost oppressive;
indeed, I was relieved when I had closed the door
between us. Nothing else had passed between the
Baroness and me; it was evident, that she regarded
the Count as an object of fear; indeed, it could hardly
have been otherwise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Time had slipped away, and the summer evening
was advanced when I turned towards my hotel. As it
promised to be a fine moonlight night, I, after some
hesitation, determined to dine at once and ride out
afterwards to Schönval. While waiting for dinner, I
got into conversation with mine host, a bustling,
talkative fellow. I was not much in the humour for
the chatter of the man in the street, still, it was rather
a relief after the strain of the afternoon&rsquo;s critical
fencing.</p>

<p>Presently I asked him, the matter being uppermost
in my mind, about the drowning of Fräulein von
Winterstein, and whether the body had been found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although they are searching the
river for miles. But the task is not so easy, mein
Herr. There are known to be great rocks in that part
of the river&rsquo;s bed&mdash;the country is rocky there&mdash;and
what so likely as that the poor lady, falling from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>that height, never rose again, but was swept by the
strong current under one of those rocks, where she
may lie till the Day of Judgment. Well, it is a
mystery we cannot understand&mdash;the chances of life
and death. A greatly admired lady, mein Herr,
young, beautiful, with a long and happy life before
her, as we might think, one hour, and in the next
gone in a moment into Eternity, no trace left, as one
might say, to show she had ever existed. It is a great
enigma, mein Herr, and, if you please, your dinner is
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The solution of the enigma which I thought I held
was not calculated to add relish to the meal. I made
a bad dinner; the bustle of the room only accentuating
the contrast of the common-place life with its sinister
background. I lighted a cigar, and ordered my horse
to be brought round in ten minutes&rsquo; time. Then, and
only then, for other thoughts had been all-absorbing,
I remembered the letter I had left with the Consul.
&ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;In another
minute I should have gone off and forgotten that,
probably remembered it towards my journey&rsquo;s end,
and had to ride back for fear of complications.&rdquo; So I
sent word to have my horse kept in the stable against
my return, and went off on foot to the Consul&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He seemed rather relieved to see me, or, perhaps
at not having to act on my instructions. &ldquo;You have
called for your letter? I wondered how soon you
would come back for it.&rdquo; He unlocked the drawer
and gave it me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are glad to get rid of it. Don&rsquo;t
think me eccentric, only I fancied I might be going to
run a certain risk this afternoon, and the fact that
word of my whereabouts had been left with you might
have been a trump card to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turnour gave me a look of comprehension. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you stay and smoke a cigar with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I would, but am riding back to
Schönval to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked surprised. &ldquo;A long ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a lovely night. I shall enjoy it. By the
way, Turnour, do you know anything of Count
Furello?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked curiously at me and laughed gently.
&ldquo;You are not riding with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. He is a naturalized German. His
father was an impecunious Italian Count, who came
to these parts fortune hunting, and married a native
heiress; at least, so we&rsquo;ve heard. He has an estate in
the Geierthal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Anything more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, except that he is a great friend, some
say&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;some say a creature,
an <i>âme damnée</i> of Rallenstein&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s everything. I guessed as much. He
is rather a character,&rdquo; I said guardedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Yes. I don&rsquo;t presume to offer you advice,
but were I in your place, I should not get too thick
with <i>il Conte</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded, thanked him, and went off.</p>

<p>I have often wondered since at the reality of the
fate or Providence which ordained that I should forget
that letter till the last minute before my intended
start. At the moment I was annoyed at having let it
slip my memory, and so omitted to utilize in fetching it
the time I wasted in waiting for dinner. And yet,
had I done so, I should have missed the extraordinary
series of adventures, and something more, which that
chance forgetfulness threw in my way.</p>

<p>For as I was retracing my steps from the Consul&rsquo;s
house to my hotel, a most startling thing happened.</p>

<p>It was now dark. The purely residential streets
of the city were more or less deserted, and the houses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>closed for the night. I walked through a square and
into a tree-lined street of old houses leading out of
it in the direction of the Königstrasse.</p>

<p>I hardly know what made me stop, hesitate and
cross the road at a particular point about midway up
the street. My mind was busy with thoughts and
plans, and my steps seem to have taken me across the
road mechanically, without any definite design. But
considering the consequences of that trivial act, I
have always set it down to something stronger and
more occult than mere chance. I remember casually
noticing that the house towards which I crossed was
lighted up, one of the first floor windows was open,
and from it came the sound of a pianoforte. As I
reached the kerb I was startled from my thoughts by
an object which fell with a sharp click upon the pavement
at my feet.</p>

<p>A small white fan.</p>

<p>I picked it up and looked round. No one was near.
Then up at the house before which I was standing.
There was nothing to be seen at the windows to indicate
where the fan had dropped from; no shadow on
the blinds, no movement to be seen within. Stepping
back to look up, I noticed that one of the top windows
was half-open, but there seemed no light in the
room, and no sign of any one there. Then I looked
at the fan in my hand. A plain but good one of white
silk with ivory ribs. Too good at least to admit
the suggestion that it had been deliberately thrown
away as worthless. It had evidently been accidentally
dropped out of the window, and I stood there
momentarily expecting the door to open and a
servant to come out and seek it. But no one came;
so, after waiting awhile, I went up to the door, and
rang.</p>

<p>Standing there ready to give in the fan with a
word of explanation, I began to open and shut it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>carelessly, as, when waiting, one will fidget with the
thing nearest to one&rsquo;s hand. As in doing this, the
light from above the door fell upon it, my casual
glance was arrested by something I had not noticed
before. There was pencilled writing across the fan.
As I turned and held it up closer to read the words,
footsteps sounded within, and I had scarcely made
out the purport of the writing when the door opened.
Simultaneously by a quick movement I closed the
fan and dropped my hand, so that it was hidden behind
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Herr Steinmetz live here?&rdquo; I stammered,
using the first name that came to my tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mein Herr,&rdquo; the servant answered, a dark,
disagreeable-looking fellow, I thought, holding the
door but a little way open and regarding me with
manifest suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not know which is the number? No?
Thank you. I am sorry to have troubled you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next moment the door was shut with a slam and I
was walking away down the street. At the second
lamp I stopped, then took out the fan to read the
words more carefully. They were these, scribbled as
though in haste:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in danger of my life. Help me. Asta
von Winterstein.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE LIVING DEAD</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asta von Winterstein!</span></p>

<p>I wondered for a moment whether I was not dreaming.
I read the words over twice again, searched the
fan for others, and finding none, thrust it into my
pocket. Then I went back to the house, crossing
the road the better to survey it from the other side
of the street.</p>

<p>Asta von Winterstein! But she was dead, killed
in that premeditated accident on the Salenberg
road. Or, perhaps, was this another trick of the
Chancellor&rsquo;s, and was she alive after all? Or had
the attempt failed, and in place of the merciful
swiftness of that rush into eternity had she escaped
to endure the longer agony of the fear of a death sure,
yet uncertain as to its time and manner? I knew
well enough from Szalay&rsquo;s and Lindheim&rsquo;s cases what
that meant. I could believe anything of Rallenstein
the Jaguar, anything. Nothing could surprise me,
nothing seemed improbable.</p>

<p>I walked quickly along the street till I came to the
portico of a great house at the end. Here, sheltered
from observation, I took out the fan and re-read the
fateful sentence. It fascinated me. I could not
keep my eyes from it. The poor girl&rsquo;s face and form
came back to my mind, vividly, now, as I had seen
her at the dance. I hardly dared to think of the unspeakable
agony that house might enclose. What
could I do? I was worse than helpless; a stranger,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>in a country where the government was a law unto
itself. I went back to the house, looking eagerly
for a sign that I might act upon. No one was to be
seen at any of the windows, though the piano still
sounded. Ugh! it set my teeth on edge. A waltz
was being played softly; a dance of death, indeed!
I walked up and down the street, not knowing what
to do; realizing my utter helplessness, yet without
being able to leave the spot. Since that night I have
often thought how foolish it was of me thus to court
suspicion, but at the time the horror I felt made me
too reckless to care for that.</p>

<p>Presently as I passed there was a movement to be
seen within the lighted-up room. A shadow came between
the light and the window. Then the light was
extinguished. I took my stand in the obscurity of a
doorway and watched. The blind was drawn aside,
then a figure appeared, a man, the fellow who had
opened the door to me. He shut the window, withdrew,
and all was darkness and silence, for the light
in the hall was out.</p>

<p>I waited a while in my new position with my eyes
fixed on the top window, whence it seemed the fan
had been thrown out; but nothing rewarded my
watch. It was getting late. In spite of the alarm
my absence would cause Von Lindheim I determined
to stay the night in Buyda. I could not bring myself
to ride away, disregarding that appeal, though it was
manifest how little it was in my power to arrest the
approaching tragedy.</p>

<p>I quitted my corner and made my way with all
speed to the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have changed my mind, I stay here to-night,&rdquo;
I said to the landlord. &ldquo;It may be some time yet
before I turn in, but have a room ready for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I went round to the stables, and by the dim
light of a lantern saw a fellow asleep on some sacks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>in a corner. I was proceeding to rouse him when I
saw that he was in livery; the coachman, possibly,
of some other guest. A pair of great black carriage
horses stood in the stalls beside my nag. The harness
was on them; they were evidently going out again
that night. I don&rsquo;t know what roused my curiosity
and induced me to look closer. On the harness was a
device, a coronet, and, underneath, a cypher, G. F.
I went out into the yard. A roomy carriage stood
under a shelter. Striking a match I examined the
panels. On them was emblazoned a coat of arms,
with the same coronet above and the same cypher
below. Footsteps sounded on the cobbles of the yard.
It was the ostler. I told him I should not want my
horse that night; I was sorry to have kept him up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mein Herr, there is no bed for me
yet. A gentleman&rsquo;s carriage going out at midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the horses I saw in the stable just now.
They are splendid animals. Whom do they belong
to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Count Furello, mein Herr,&rdquo; the man
answered with the importance of his kind over a
distinguished customer. Somehow I was prepared
for the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Count travels late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mein Herr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved off towards the stables and I let him go,
judging there was not much information to be got out
of him. But I resolved to try what under the circumstances
was a pardonable piece of eavesdropping;
so, after a feint of going into the hotel, I crept back
and placed myself outside the stable window.</p>

<p>The ostler had evidently roused the sleeping coachman,
and they were now rallying one another with
rough pleasantry. Presently, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the bed I shall
get this night,&rdquo; the sleepy coachman exclaimed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>a yawn. &ldquo;Five hours&rsquo; hard driving to-day with
scarce a minute for a schoppen of beer. Our Herr
Bleisst can play the devil when he chooses, and the
Herr Graf too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He drives at the devil&rsquo;s time, truly,&rdquo; the ostler
laughed. &ldquo;Midnight, through the woods. Poor
Carl! I shall remember you when I am snug in bed.
Ah! You will be ready for breakfast when you reach
the Geierthal to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They said nothing more to which I could attach any
importance, but I had heard enough. It was only
natural that I should connect this midnight journey
with the message on the fan. One thing struck
me as being particularly significant. At the Baroness&rsquo;s
house that afternoon, Count Furello had said
that he was going to his home in the Geierthal; but
why was he travelling at night and by road?</p>

<p>According to his coachman, his carriage had posted
up from the Geierthal that morning, with such haste
as hardly to give the man time to get refreshment.
That circumstance, coupled with what I knew of the
Count, enabled me to conceive a likely idea of what
was going on. I went into the hotel, had some supper,
and at half-past eleven was back in the gloomy street,
which I found was called the Neckarstrasse. The
house was dark and silent as I left it. I lighted a
cigar and walked up and down, waiting for midnight,
when I felt sure something would happen. I was
not wrong. It wanted but a few minutes to the hour,
when, stopping to turn, I could hear at some distance
the rumble of a vehicle approaching at a walking pace.
At first I thought it could not be what I expected;
but as it turned into the street I saw that my suspicion
was correct. It was the carriage I had seen in
the hotel yard; it looked almost funereal, coming
along at a foot&rsquo;s pace, with its pair of big black horses.
The slow rate of progression had the effect of making
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>very little noise; if the carriage had dashed up to the
door, probably half the street would have been roused.
As it passed me, the light from a lamp fell on the
rather flamboyant device on the panel, but I needed
not that to make sure. It drew up at the door of the
house whence the fan had come; I had followed
close behind, and as the carriage stopped, I slipped
unnoticed into the portico of the next house; a
risky position to take up, but I was resolved, come
what might, to see who the occupants of the carriage
were to be. The coachman made no attempt to give
notice of his arrival, but sat on his box motionless as I,
leaning back in the shadow.</p>

<p>Presently, it may have been after ten minutes&rsquo;
waiting, the driver&rsquo;s head turned sharply towards the
door, then I heard the click of the lock, and a man,
the same who had opened the door to me, came out
and looked up and down the street with an air of reconnoitring.
Apparently satisfied, he spoke a few words
in a low tone to the coachman and went quickly into
the house again.</p>

<p>In a short time he reappeared with what seemed a
basket and a travelling bag. These he placed inside
the carriage. Then he brought out a valise, which,
with the help of the coachman, he stowed away under
the box. He now stood by the carriage door, waiting.
I could hear people moving and speaking in a low tone.
Then the man held the door open. I came forward,
standing behind the pillar and leaning over the railing
to get as good a view as possible. Two men came
down the steps, conducting between them a lady so
wrapped up and veiled that I could not have seen her
face even from a nearer point of view. They were
followed by a young woman, whom I seemed to
recognize as she who had called herself Miss Seemarsh,
but of this the darkness prevented my being sure.
The man farthest from me I at once recognized as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Count Furello. His was not a face to forget. He
got into the carriage first, next the veiled lady was
handed in by the other man, after which the second
lady entered, the man shut the door, and jumped up
to the box beside the coachman, who turned the
horses and drove slowly off in the direction he had
come. The footman stood looking after them till
they were out of the street, then went in, and I came
out from my hiding-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are taking that girl off to her death,&rdquo; I
cried, walking quickly after them; &ldquo;nothing can be
done by me to save her. But, hopeless as it may be, I
will not leave her to these fiends without an effort
to rescue her. Thank Heaven, I know their destination;
if you are to die, my poor Asta, at least a
friend shall be near you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph3">A WASTREL</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was scarcely dawn when I rode out of Buyda on
my way back to Schönvalhof. With a feeling of
relief I struck the high road and entered the open
country. Buyda, beautiful city though it undoubtedly
was, had become hateful to me as a veritable net of
sinister intrigue, with that great relentless spider
sitting in the midst marking down his prey.</p>

<p>I reached Schönvalhof without incident, and before
many people were astir. The house was closed, and
I was considerably reassured (for I had my fears),
after ringing a loud peal at the bell, to see presently
Lindheim&rsquo;s face at the window. He seemed more
relieved than even I, and ran down to let me in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A delightful night I have passed!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I made sure when midnight came and you had not
returned, that you had paid the penalty of your
rashness. Well, what news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I related the events of my day in Buyda; my interview
with Rallenstein, my visit to the Baroness and
meeting with Count Furello, and lastly, the episode
of the fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not think me a broken reed, my dear
Lindheim,&rdquo; I said in conclusion, &ldquo;when you learn I
have only called in here on my way to the Geierthal.
That girl is in awful danger, is quite helpless in the
hands of these villains, and I should be worse than a
coward if, after having received that appeal, I should
ignore it and make no attempt to save her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but fear you
can do nothing. There is no law to which you can
appeal, which is not at once over-ruled by the higher
law of political expediency. Count Furello is, as
we know, the Jaguar&rsquo;s paw. Although he holds a
good position in his part of the country, they say
Rallenstein knows enough against him to bring him
to the scaffold to-morrow if he wished. No doubt
he has been watching us here, superintending the work
of his confederates, and has only left because he was
wanted for this business, and his master sent for him.
You will run a great risk, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;any present danger
is better than a life-long self-reproach. My only
regret is that it involves my deserting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;Not necessarily. For, if you are
determined to go, I would ask you to let me come
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; I thought a moment. &ldquo;I am not sure
that it would be a bad move for you. You cannot
stay here much longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone? no. It is nervous work enough with a
friend. I have not slept all night. Let me come
with you and meet my danger in the open if it has to
be met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t value Rallenstein&rsquo;s assurance, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure my life would not be worth twenty-four
hours&rsquo; purchase in Buyda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come, and the sooner we start the better.
I fear there is not much to be done, but we shall at
least be company for each other. How far is the
Geierthal from here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much more than thirty miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I propose we make an early start, take a
long rest by the way, and get to the place towards
evening. We can best reconnoitre after dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a substantial breakfast, we hurriedly made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>preparations for having some necessary baggage sent
to us under an assumed name at Carlzig, the nearest
town to the Geierthal, provided ourselves each with a
serviceable revolver and a bag of cartridges, and set
out. Guns and fishing-rods were to be sent after us,
our ostensible reason for the excursion being sport,
which abounded in those regions.</p>

<p>On our way we turned aside to the house of the
village priest, whom Lindheim requested to take in
hand the arrangements for the funeral of poor Szalay.
The priest had been an old friend of Lindheim&rsquo;s
father, so could be trusted with the true explanation
of Szalay&rsquo;s sudden death, and the necessity of our
departure. He promised to receive any of the family
as Lindheim&rsquo;s representative, and to act in the
whole matter as his discretion might dictate.</p>

<p>This settled, we rode on; but before leaving the
village a suspicious curiosity impelled me to turn
aside for a few minutes and to climb the rocks, the
scene of my narrow escape two days before. With
some difficulty I succeeded in mounting to the brow
whence the great mass had been dislodged. For my
idea now was that this fall had not been accidental,
and it needed only a cursory glance to confirm that
suspicion. The rock had evidently been bored, and
the upper part cleft and hurled down by an explosive,
a small charge having probably, from its over-hanging
position, sufficed to effect its dislodgment. So sure
of impunity had my would-be murderers obviously
considered themselves, that they had not troubled in
any way to remove the evidences of their design.
My feeling now was almost one of indifference, since
this was only another proof of what we knew well&mdash;the
cunning, relentless malignity with which we were
being pursued.</p>

<p>Thus satisfied, I quickly rejoined Von Lindheim,
and we soon had left the village far behind us. After
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>that we slackened our speed, taking frequent rests,
and, as we had planned, towards evening found ourselves
in a little hamlet about a mile from the Monastery
of the Geierthal. We were more lucky than
we anticipated in finding a fairly comfortable roadside
inn, where we took up our quarters and ordered
dinner. While the meal was preparing I went out
for a stroll along the valley to see if a glimpse was to
be had of the Monastery.</p>

<p>After walking for about twenty minutes I came to a
point where the pine-covered hills on one side opened
out, falling away and leaving a great circle of flat
country of, perhaps, a mile in diameter, after which
they closed up again and the valley resumed its
course. It was here in this lower ground that I
rightly guessed the old Monastery must be; it was
just such a spot as the monks were wont to choose for
their dwelling-place, and the next turn in my path
gave me a peep of a great house showing here and there
between the trees which grew down to the edge of a
broad band of water which encircled it. Remembering
the Baroness&rsquo;s description of the Monastery on an
island I needed no further guide. A few steps on
brought me to a gate in a fence which evidently ran
round the property. The path I had taken was, then,
one leading to the Monastery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trespass this side of dinner,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;but it is just as well to have got my bearings by
daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So after a good look round I turned and retraced my
steps to the inn.</p>

<p>Von Lindheim met me with a rather perturbed
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More complications,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;fate is dogging
me still. The Jaguar&rsquo;s long paw has already reached
to the Geierthal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A stranger is at the inn already. An Englishman,
or, at least, one who speaks English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another spurious Professor&mdash;of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sportsman this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Singing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho! Let us investigate. I may be able to
tell the genuine article better than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went in. In the passage Lindheim touched
me on the arm and I stopped. From the inner room
came a man&rsquo;s voice, an Englishman&rsquo;s evidently,
singing in a more or less burlesque fashion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The plighted ring he wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was crushed and wet with gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet ere he doied<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He bravely croied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ve kept the vow I swore-hoa-hore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ve ke-he-hept the vo-how-how I swore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;An Englishman?&rdquo; I asked the landlord who came
to tell us our dinner was ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, an Englishman,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He shoots
the birds and hares for miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lives here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mein Herr. He lives up in the hills, a good
step from here. But he always comes to my house
when he is near for a schoppen of lager-beer or a
glass of schnaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Then he has been here for some time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A month, two months, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded to Lindheim, &ldquo;I think it is all right.
But we will go in and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was sitting at a table by the window and filling
his pipe as we entered. An Englishman, certainly, I
thought, and of a type not uncommon. A darkish,
sunburnt complexion, fearless blue-grey eyes, a
drooping moustache, and perhaps a trifle too much
heaviness in the jaw; the sort of man you see scores
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>of in the West End during the summer months and
very few in the winter, the type from which our best
soldiers and sportsmen are drawn. He was dressed
in a workmanlike if rather shabby shooting-suit, and
his gun and cartridge-bag stood in the corner beside
him.</p>

<p>On our appearance he looked up casually, and as his
eye rested on me a slight beam of recognition came
into it, such as one Englishman gives another when
they meet abroad. I bowed, and we both seemed
inclined to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we are fellow-countrymen,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Englishmen are apt to meet in out-of-the-way
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he replied with a slight drawl. &ldquo;Last
place I expected to run against one in. Nothing to
see; all nature and no art, and the nature not quite
on the tourist scale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not exactly tourists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know this part of the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. We have come over to try and get sport
of some kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good man! I&rsquo;ve been blazing away for the last
six or eight weeks. I&rsquo;m shooting for a game shop
in Carlzig. So much a head, with board and lodging
and a decent cottage thrown in. Like our dealers&rsquo;
moors in England, only they do you better at home;
prices are higher. Will you join me, sport or profit?
As it is I am in danger of forgetting my mother
tongue. Haven&rsquo;t heard the English language in all
its native purity from any lips but my own for months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said we should be glad to have a day with him.
Charged as I was with suspicion of everyone I met,
I could not bring myself to think this man was not
genuine; so far as his nationality went, he certainly
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Strode,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Hamilton Strode.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>My people are Hampshire, but they&rsquo;ve cut my painter
and I&rsquo;m adrift with one oar; &rsquo;tother slipped overboard
and I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to pick it up. Still,
I&rsquo;m keeping on with a certain amount of vim. I was
in the Scots Fusiliers till the Hebrews became too
oppressive and I got a hint. Our Colonel, old
Lampton, said he didn&rsquo;t mind a Jew or two as a general
thing; in a crack regiment it was to be expected,
but when a man couldn&rsquo;t go into his officers&rsquo; quarters
without tumbling over the whole twelve tribes of
Israel it was coming it too strong. People were beginning
to make unkind remarks about the S. F. G.&rsquo;s
adding Houndsditch to their territorial designations,
and he&rsquo;d be pole-axed if the thing should go on. So
I was run out, like many a better chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We expressed our sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I dare say I am a queer
member, a bad lot, and all that; but if you&rsquo;ll give
me your company I can show you some sport, the best
in these parts, and I&rsquo;ll give my parole not to try to
borrow money of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that assurance he presently went off in
great content.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE LIGHT IN THE WOOD</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> dinner I left Von Lindheim, who was tired
with his long ride after a sleepless night, and set out
from the inn for a closer inspection of the Monastery.
It was a good night for my purpose, being bright and
obscure at intervals as great banks of drifting clouds
passed over the moon. I soon arrived at the gate,
which did not stop me this time. I went through
and began to make my way more circumspectly on
the private grounds through the thick belt of wood
which encircled the moat. To the water&rsquo;s edge was
but some two hundred paces, and coincident with
my reaching it, the moon shone forth and gave me, like
the withdrawing of a veil, a perfect view of the house
and its surroundings. They were romantic enough.
Imagine a grey, rambling pile with all the characteristics
of mediæval fortified domestic architecture,
toned by an ecclesiastical suggestion over all, standing
insulated in the middle of a broad belt of water,
surrounded again by wood growing down to its margin,
and which, on two sides, after falling back for a short
distance on almost level ground, rose abruptly to a
considerable height, making a dark background
opposite to where I stood.</p>

<p>Such was my general view of the place; I now
proceeded to make a more detailed and practical
observation. Keeping just within the obscurity of
the trees I began to make my way round the moat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>principally to ascertain the difficulties of approach
to the building. They soon showed themselves to be
formidable enough. There was in fact only one
legitimate way of entry, by a drawbridge, to meet
which a pier ran out half-way across the wide moat.
This drawbridge, which was pulled up, was worked
from a massive square tower with portcullis gate, the
usual gate-house tower of fortified buildings. Not
much chance of getting over there, so I went on to see
what facilities the other side might present. There
were none. The band of water became no narrower as
I had rather hoped, and as far as I could see (for the
deep shadows made accurate observation impossible)
the main portion of the building rose sheer from the
water. I was rather surprised at this, for I had
imagined that in modern times the motive of convenience
would have led to the construction of a
second means of access. But there was none, and I
told myself that the only way of reaching the other
side unobserved would be to swim for it. A prison
indeed, I thought, for that poor girl, and a secure
place of execution. The idea spurred me to leave no
attempt at rescue untried; accordingly, I went round
the edge of the moat, searching vainly for some indication
as to the most likely place where I might
swim over and discover her prison. It seemed almost
hopeless. Was she, indeed, still alive? She and
her captors would have arrived some time that morning,
and much might have happened since then.
Were they here after all? The journey to the Geierthal
might have been a feint. No. I argued it out,
and came to the conclusion that it was genuine
enough. And what better prison or death-place could
these authorized murderers have desired than this?
The whole affair was a hideous puzzle to me; still,
I was resolved to do what I could to rescue the girl.
So I determined I would lose no more time in futile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>speculations but would swim the moat and set to
work to find her.</p>

<p>Now a strange thing came to my notice. I had
begun to throw off my outer clothing preparatory
to slipping into the water, and was stooping down on
one knee unlacing my boots, when my eye came in
line with a faint glimmer of light. My face was
towards the wood, turned away for the time from the
building, and this light, seen through the trees when
I struck a particular line of vision, and lost again when
I moved out of it, seemed to be some little distance,
a hundred paces, perhaps, within the wood and close to
the ground. I watched it for a while, and being
quite unable to account for it, quietly put on my
clothes again and crept warily towards the place for a
closer inspection. Betokening, as seemed probable,
the presence of persons in the wood, I was rather
startled to find how near I had come to being
discovered.</p>

<p>As I got closer, with fewer trees to intercept my
view of the light, it puzzled me more than ever. For
it appeared to rise from the earth and irradiate feebly
the gaunt trunks of the surrounding trees. For a
moment my mind went back to the fairy tales of the
land, but any such fanciful suggestion was dispelled
by a movement at the spot whence the glow proceeded.
The light was intercepted for an instant by
something which passed over it. An object rose
from the ground, as though it were thrown up. This
action was now repeated in fairly quick succession,
and I could make a shrewd guess at the explanation.
I crept nearer, the thick carpet of pine needles deadening
my footsteps. When I had advanced as close as I
dared I slipped behind a tree and watched for what
next would happen. I could see quite clearly now
what was before hidden by the shadow cast where
the light did not reach. Earth was being thrown up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>Presently there was a pause in this operation, two
objects appeared above the surface about three feet
apart. The hands of a man in the act of stretching
himself. Some one was there digging. What? A
grave? The conjecture gave me a thrill. I felt sure
now of poor Asta von Winterstein&rsquo;s fate, and this,
merciful Providence! this unholy work was for her
last resting-place. While her parents were vainly
and sorrowfully searching for her body in the river
fifty miles away, she had been quietly brought to this
house of death and&mdash;&mdash;. I was roused from my
thoughts, maddening in the very sense of helplessness
to avert the tragedy, by a movement of the light.
An old-fashioned lantern whence it came was now
raised and set upon the edge of the hole, out of which
scrambled afterwards the figure of a man, thick set
and so short as to be almost a dwarf. He looked
round as though expecting somebody; then taking a
pipe from his pocket he lit it from the lantern and sat
down to smoke. His action convinced me that he
was waiting for some one, perhaps&mdash;I shuddered&mdash;the
bearers of the body to be buried there, and this
gave me warning to be on my guard. Nevertheless, I
was determined to see the affair out; indeed, had I
wished, I could hardly have retreated now without
attracting the man&rsquo;s notice. I had not long to wait.
Behind me from the direction of the moat came a
peculiar noise, indefinable, yet denoting an approaching
presence. The man knocked out his pipe and
set himself to rake together a heap of pine needles.
I crouched down as close as I could get to the bole of
the tree which hid me. A man came along slowly,
passing me at a distance of about ten paces. He was
half-dragging, half carrying some heavy object, which
in the darkness I could not make out, and which I
feared to see. As he passed between me and the light
I could stand up and get a better view. The man was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>dressed in a long hooded over-garment like a monk&rsquo;s
cassock, and to my relief I saw that what he was
carrying was merely a large hurdle. The other man
came forward to meet him, and between them they
laid the hurdle across the hole. Then they went off
towards the moat, leaving the light, which was lucky,
as had they carried it with them they might have seen
me. As it was, the darkness was so impenetrable that
I had little fear of detection if only they did not
actually run against me.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they returned bearing two more
hurdles. These also they placed across the grave,
if such it were, so that, as I judged, it was completely
covered over. Then the second man threw off his
long cassock, and they both began to shovel earth
upon the hurdles, and over that they carefully spread
a layer of pine needles. Their faces, so far as the dim
light allowed me to make them out, were villainous
to a degree, but perhaps their surroundings, their
occupation, and my own frame of mind did them less
than justice. Anyhow, they were singularly repulsive.</p>

<p>When their work of concealment was finished,
each put on his cassock, drawing the hood over his
head, then they took up the lantern, the spades and
mattock, and returned towards the moat.</p>

<p>So, I thought, the grave is ready, but it is not to be
occupied to-night. In anticipation of their passing
with the light I had retreated to a spot more removed
from their path. When they were at a safe distance I
began cautiously to follow them, which was rendered
easy by the light, which told me of their whereabouts.
When once they emerged from the wood to the
water&rsquo;s edge I could see them clearly against the moonlight.
They had put out the lantern, and from a
clump of bushes proceeded to unmoor a boat. Then,
getting in, these unholy familiars pulled across the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>moat, landed at what seemed some steps by a small
postern, made the boat fast in such a way that it lay
hidden behind the steps, and silently disappeared
through the door, which closed upon them.</p>

<p>Here, then, was my point of reconnaissance; not a
very promising one, it is true, but worth trying. The
door was well contrived, for, in the shadow cast by
a buttress, both it and its approach were secure from
observation. Keenly as I had examined the wall,
they had quite escaped my notice. From what I had
seen I felt pretty certain that the grave in the wood
was not to be visited again that night. So, after
waiting a short while, I put into practice my interrupted
plan of swimming across the moat for a
closer examination. The water was fairly warm, and
some twenty strokes landed me at the steps, which,
as I had supposed, were formed on the outside of a
small stone arch, the inside of which formed a boat-house.
I crept up the steps and tried the door;
it was fast closed, and an examination of it convinced
me that an entrance that way was practically impossible
unless I should chance to find it left open. Satisfied
of this, I next untied the boat, got in, and began
a tour round the building, working myself warily
along the wall, which rose sheer from the water.
My search for any indication of the poor girl&rsquo;s prison
was fruitless. The few barred windows I passed
were dark and all silent within, neither in any part of
the building could I see any sign of life. Presently,
I came to the end of the wall, to a spot where I could
land and examine the place from the other side.
Very cautiously I made the boat fast and got out.
Keeping well in the shadow of the walls I crept round
the front of the Monastery. To my surprise all was
dark on this side too; not a glimmer at any of the
windows; the whole as silent as a ruin. Search as
I would, nothing could be seen that gave me the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>least hope of accomplishing my purpose. So at
length my shivering limbs and the obvious futility of
further effort told me I must abandon my effort at
any rate for that night. It was saddening to think
that perhaps even that moment the vile deed might
be in course of perpetration, but what could I do
with absolutely nothing to guide me? So, after a
final scrutiny, I got back into the boat, returned
the way that I had come, left it in its place, swam back
huddled on my clothes, and ran at a swinging pace
home to the inn by way of restoring my circulation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">WHAT WE SAW AT CARLZIG</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next day a strange thing happened, of which a
mere chance, in the first place, gave me the explanation.
I was, needless to say, very disheartened at
what seemed the absolute impossibility of attempting
to rescue poor Asta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is all over with her by this time,&rdquo;
I said to Von Lindheim, when I had related what I
had seen the night before. &ldquo;At any rate, if she is
still alive her sand is running very low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here, indoors,&rdquo; I said; for the whole
affair was on my nerves, and I felt almost suffocated
in the little inn. &ldquo;You had better not come with me;
but I am going to have a look at that grave, and see if
it is as they left it last night. After that we will go
into Carlzig together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, I set off along the valley, skirting this
time the boundary of the private wood until I came
to a point about opposite to where the men had been at
work. Here, by the aid of a tree, I climbed over the
high wall and went cautiously through the wood
leading down to the water. Happily, for my presence
in the wood was risky, the distance was short, and
when once I got sight of the Monastery, and could
take my bearings from the little door, I had no difficulty
in finding what I sought. The raised mass of earth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>spread with pine needles was there; the hurdles,
covered in like manner, were in position. I lifted one
and looked down with a shudder into what it covered.
A grave, without doubt, though empty as yet. The
place was evidently untouched since the men left it
overnight. That was all I had come to see; so far I
was satisfied, and having replaced the hurdle, covered
as I found it, I made my way with all speed out of the
grounds, and so back to Von Lindheim. Then we set
off together to Carlzig.</p>

<p>I was in rather a depressed state of mind, not
seeing what I could do towards effecting the purpose
that had brought me there. My feeling now was that
the only thing to do was just to keep watch, in the
faint hope that chance might show me an opening
into that house of mystery and death. But the hope
was so slender as to be scarcely more than despair,
for I was convinced that the quiet, cold-blooded
tragedy I dared not think about would be accomplished
by that evening.</p>

<p>Beyond the man who had accompanied Count
Furello from Buyda, and the two ruffians I had seen
in the wood, I was ignorant of the strength of his
household; at the same time I realized that, even
had I a dozen men at my back, to attempt to rescue
Fräulein von Winterstein by force would be absurd.
It would only make matters worse. There was no
law to be invoked; the whole force, moral and
physical, open and secret, of the Government would
be against me. If the poor girl&rsquo;s death were deemed
necessary for State reasons, not even her parents
could have a valid protest against it.</p>

<p>The walk into Carlzig took us, perhaps, two hours.
It was through a picturesquely wild country, which,
however, seemed to me that day dreary and gloomy
in the extreme. Until within a mile or two of the
town we saw scarcely a living soul; no fitter locality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>for the Hostel of St. Tranquillin (as we were told
the Monastery was named) could have been chosen.</p>

<p>Carlzig we found a fair-sized town, duller even
than such places at midday usually are. We looked
up and claimed our baggage, and arranged for a
carriage to drive back with it. Then, having made a
few purchases, we went to the principal inn for
luncheon. When this was over and we were paying
our bill, I felt Von Lindheim touch my foot significantly
under the table. I looked up quickly, following
the direction of his eyes, with a half apprehension
that I should see the man uppermost in my mind
just then, Count Furello.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>The person he meant me to notice was a clean-shaven
cleric, a round-faced, rather distinguished-looking
man, whose general air and manner suggested
that he had mistaken his profession. He had come
into the room with a hand valise, as though from a
journey, and was now refreshing himself with a
bottle of wine, a bumper of which he poured down
his throat in a style not quite becoming his cloth.
But his face told me nothing more, and I glanced
back inquiringly at my companion. He looked serious
enough, but merely returned a slight frown to
silence me. Then he rose; I followed. As we went
out the priest looked up carelessly, but no sign of
recognition passed between him and Von Lindheim.
A waiting-maid bustling in with the man&rsquo;s dishes
prevented any further notice with which he might
have been inclined to favour us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who on earth was that?&rdquo; I asked directly we
were in the street. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t imagine you saw <i>il
Conte</i> under that disguise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered shortly, and went on. After a
few steps he stopped, as though to inspect a particularly
uninteresting shop window, but, as I knew,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>as an excuse for looking round. Then we walked on
again, and he took my arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you think that was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who married the Princess and Von
Orsova.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; I could only whistle in surprise.
&ldquo;What in the world is he doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I am wondering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His cure may be near this place. But then, why
does he travel with a bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lunch at an hotel. A man of that sort would
have had a meal before he started, or brought some
<i>wurst</i> sandwiches in his pocket. I think he had come
a long journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is not at the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or why does he go to an inn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Lindheim; it is suspicious.
Shall we keep watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a smaller inn nearly opposite to that in
which we had lunched. We went in, called for
coffee, and took up our position at the window commanding
the street. For a long while we saw nothing
of the priest, but at length, just as we were wondering
whether we were not perhaps losing our time, a
closed carriage rumbled along the street and drew
up at some distance below our inn. A man alighted
and appeared to give some directions to the coachman,
who turned his horses and drove off the way he had
come. The man walked up the street towards us;
not a prepossessing fellow by any means, with his
long nose, stubby black moustache, swarthy complexion,
and restless way of looking about him.
Something told me instinctively that he was making
for the hotel opposite us. Such was the case; he
went in, returning in a few minutes, as we felt certain
he would, with the priest carrying his valise. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>went down the street in the direction the carriage
had taken. When they had gone a safe distance we
went out and followed them. The man who had
fetched the priest kept looking round; he was a fellow
who, though far from being the salt of the earth, would
have been turned into a good imitation thereof in the
days of Lot. A suspicious curiosity was with him
evidently second nature. However, we kept too
far behind for him to be able to distinguish what
manner of men we were, and we were careful to adopt
a pantomime calculated to disarm suspicion.</p>

<p>On they went till they reached the outskirts of
the town, and there, just beyond the bridge where
the road crossed the river, we saw the carriage waiting.
They got in, the priest first, his companion following
after a good look round, which, however, we took
care should not fall on us. Then they drove quickly
off, the road they took being that which led to the
Geierthal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Von Lindheim asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. Except that I am certain they have
gone to the Hostel. Who knows? Perhaps those
butchers are methodical enough in their trade to give
their victims Christian burial. Ah! it&rsquo;s horrible.
Let us get back. I must see the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph3">THE MIDNIGHT BURIAL</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darkness</span> had barely fallen when I was back again
in the Monastery wood. Von Lindheim had offered
to accompany me, but I had thought it better not to
bring him. In the first place I anticipated little to
be done except watching, and one pair of eyes would
be as good there as two. Then if he came with me
the chances of being discovered would be increased,
since two men are easier seen than one. Beyond
these there was a stronger reason for leaving him
behind. I was convinced that pluckily as he fought
against it, his nerve was seriously shaken. He had
brightened up considerably since leaving Schönvalhof,
still it is no joke&mdash;although, brave fellow that he was,
he tried hard to treat it as one&mdash;it is no joke to go
for weeks in hourly fear of secret assassination. It
was manifest that he felt his utter helplessness to
escape ultimately from Rallenstein&rsquo;s long arm, and
indeed all the police in Europe cannot safeguard a
man from foes who, cost what it may, are resolved on
his death. Von Lindheim&rsquo;s nerves were hardly equal
to his spirit, and certainly his life since the day he
fled from Buyda had been depressing enough. So I
dissuaded him from coming with me; his help might
have been useful, even indispensable, but I thought
the chances were rather the other way. So I left
him with some literature we had brought from
Carlzig and set off alone. The Monastery was as dark
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>and silent as ever. Indeed, the strange character of
the place was its utter absence of any indication of life
within. All the same, I could not but imagine it
under that silent exterior to be full of active villainy.
Yet the dark stillness of the place seemed to chill the
nerves, and I felt glad Von Lindheim was not with me.</p>

<p>Now my plan was to keep watch near the grave,
which I first of all ascertained was still as it had been
left the night before. After some little searching in
the dark wood I found a tree, with its trunk less
bare than the rest, which I could climb and so command
a view of the grave, to which it stood quite
close, without much chance of being detected. I
took pains to mark its exact position, so that I could
find it at once, if in a hurry; then I went down to the
moat and, taking my stand opposite the postern door,
watched and waited.</p>

<p>My vigil was a long one; a light wind swept through
the trees and just ruffled the placid water before me.
A gentle shower fell, then the moon came out in her
glory, making the house of death yet more sombre
in its grey inscrutableness. Clouds drifted across the
light, hour followed hour, the great house was as grim
and hushed as ever; not a sound broke the stillness
save the overhead rustle of the trees and the occasional
&ldquo;tw-hoo&rdquo; of an owl. Still I waited on, content with
the solace of my pipe, till at last my patience was
rewarded.</p>

<p>My eyes, accustomed to the normal look of the
objects before them, caught on the wall opposite a
faint gleam of light, which I knew did not fall from
the moon. It came from the point where I should
have expected it, the door I was watching so keenly.
I rose, slipped my pipe into my pocket, and stood in
anxious expectation, ready to retreat to my hiding-place.</p>

<p>The light was now more noticeable, glancing to and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>fro; it was difficult, owing to the shadow of the
buttress, to make out anything clearly, but I was certain
that dark figures were moving about the door.
Presently I just caught the faint sound of the grazing
of the boat&rsquo;s side against the steps. They, the dark
figures, were getting into it now; the time they took
and their movements assured me that they were
bringing with them the dread burden I anticipated.
In another moment they would push off, so I judged
it time to make for my perch of observation. My
last glimpse as I retreated was of the dark boat-load
slowly advancing towards the point I had quitted.
In a few minutes more I had climbed up the tree and
swung myself into a secure position amid the thick
branches.</p>

<p>If ever a man felt sick at heart I did then, perched
there waiting for the last scene of that ghastly business.
My imagination would picture the poor girl&rsquo;s death
agony, almost a relief when it came to end that hopeless
suspense. How had their vile work been done?
Was it poison, the knife, or perhaps that mysterious
death-touch that had struck down poor Szalay?
My mind would run on the imagined scene till the
approaching sound of men&rsquo;s feet drew my thoughts to
actualities.</p>

<p>I could now see a light through the trees. The man
who carried it in a lantern was followed by two others,
bearing between them an improvised stretcher on
which was no doubt a human body. Certainly as I
had expected this, the sight made my heart give a
great throb, and I trembled as I had never done before.
The men set their burden down by the grave (it
was wrapped round in some dark cloth or canvas),
and then proceeded to remove the hurdles, the first
man still holding the light. Once when he raised
it to the level of his face I recognized him; he was the
same who had fetched the priest that afternoon from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>Carlzig. Not a word was spoken by any one of the
three, at least that I could hear. One of the hurdles
was placed beside the body, which was then laid on
it; two ropes were produced and passed underneath.
One man, the dwarf, took the ropes at the foot, while
the fellow who held the lantern came forward to help
the other man. As he did so he stooped down, and
lifting the covering from the dead face held the light
to it. An irresistible fascination overcame my desire
to avert my eyes, and it was as well it did so.</p>

<p>For with a great shock of something like relief I
recognized not the face of Asta von Winterstein, but
that of the priest we had seen that day in Carlzig.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">VON LINDHEIM&rsquo;S DEPARTURE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> probabilities now were, that Fräulein Asta von
Winterstein was still alive. Horribly shocked as I
was by what I had seen, it was yet with a feeling of
almost relief that, when the ghastly work was over,
and the men had gone, I got down from my place
of observation and went back to the inn.</p>

<p>One thing greatly annoyed me. That was the
thought of the opportunity I had missed, while
the men were engaged in the wood, of slipping into
their boat and trying whether they had not left the
little door unfastened. What I could have done
towards rescuing the imprisoned girl, even had I gained
entrance into the building, was very doubtful; still,
had I imagined that it was not her body they were
going to bury I should certainly have made the
attempt. After all my life was in no greater danger
than that of a soldier&rsquo;s in action, with, personally, a
far more imperative reason for risking it. The relation
of the night&rsquo;s deed had a bad effect on Von Lindheim,
although he manfully strove to hide it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the only man left now,&rdquo; he said bitterly,
&ldquo;who saw that affair. Is it likely that I shall be
allowed to live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did my best to give him courage, making most of
the Chancellor&rsquo;s assurance, and pointing out how
different his case was from that of the priest who had
actually performed the ceremony. But in the unstrung
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> of his nerves my arguments made little
impression, and, though he affected to take a hopeful
view, I fear he went to bed in a miserable frame of
mind.</p>

<p>Next morning Strode came over, and we prepared
to go out shooting with him. There was a certain
breeziness about my fellow-countryman that acted
as a nerve tonic. I had been worrying about Von
Lindheim during the night, and had come to the conclusion
that the only thing for him was to slip away
out of the country and put, if possible, a continent
between himself and the ruthless Chancellor. The
opportunity was apt, since, so far as we could tell,
our whereabouts was not known. Still, any hour
might bring us evidence of the contrary, and it
seemed to me that the sooner my friend was on his
way the better.</p>

<p>At breakfast I told him my idea, and was glad to
notice that it seemed to jump with his own inclination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only question is the detail,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am
sorry that I cannot come with you, but I am bound
to stay here, at any rate till I know the worst, and
perhaps, after all, you will have a better chance by
yourself, since, if Rallenstein&rsquo;s people are on the
look-out, it will naturally be for us both together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strode&rsquo;s appearance at the inn put an idea into my
head, which I thought out and communicated to him
later in the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want your advice and your help, if you&rsquo;ll give it
me,&rdquo; I said. We had walked some two or three
miles from the Geierthal on to high ground along
which ran a chain of woods well stocked with game.
Von Lindheim was some little way from us, and I had
shortened the regulation interval between Strode
and myself to speaking distance.</p>

<p>He answered eagerly, rather surprised, it seemed,
that any one should be found to ask help of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, of course I will. What&rsquo;s the
trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will give me your word it shall go no farther?&rdquo;
He nodded, and I felt I could trust him.
&ldquo;Our friend Von Lindheim is under a cloud. He is
being hunted down for political reasons. Holds a
dangerous secret, and his life is not worth twelve
hours&rsquo; purchase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strode whistled. &ldquo;Bad as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you don&rsquo;t know what vindictive fiends these
Government people are. Now, if he is to save his life
he must get away out of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think so. I&rsquo;m your man; this is
rather exciting. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a passport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ah, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea if he travelled in your name it
might put the bloodhounds off the scent. He speaks
English perfectly, as you hear. It is but a chance, still
I can&rsquo;t see a good fellow like that done to death in
cold blood without an effort to save him. He ought to
slip away quietly at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he drawled, but I could see he was thinking
it out. &ldquo;We had better head for my diggings, potting
what we can on our way. I&rsquo;ve an idea an <i>Eilwagen</i>
passes about a mile below the house between four and
five. That might do for him. We can talk it over
as we go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon we called Von Lindheim and communicated
the plan to him. The situation and his chances
were discussed as we went; details of his flight and
the safest route were arranged. The cottage, a literal
shooting-box, was soon reached, a curiously bare little
place furnished simply with necessaries, and, with the
exception perhaps of one armchair, none of the luxuries
of life. Here Strode provided an excellent luncheon,
considering the resources of the place, fish and game
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>and ham, with an assortment of <i>delicatessen</i> and a
capital bottle of wine. Then we equipped Von Lindheim
for his journey, making him as much like a
travelling Briton as possible, towards which an old
suit of Strode&rsquo;s went a long way. Everything that
could be was changed, even down to the linen, which
now bore the Englishman&rsquo;s name, proof positive of
his identity. Then, furnished with the all-important
passport, a travelling bag, a flask and sandwiches,
he set off with us to intercept the <i>Eilwagen</i>, which
was soon to pass through the valley below.</p>

<p>Both he and I were depressed at the thought of the
parting, and I am sure our minds were full of darker
forebodings than we cared to acknowledge; but
Strode&rsquo;s dry humour and happy-go-lucky temperament
kept up our spirits; carelessness of self is
infectious, as every soldier knows.</p>

<p>We reached the spot where the <i>Eilwagen</i> was to
pass, and after some twenty minutes&rsquo; waiting it lumbered
into sight. Thereupon we bade Von Lindheim
God-speed and left him, thinking it just as well
that he should appear alone. Still, in that wooded
country we were able unobserved to see the last of
him, and it was with satisfaction we noticed that the
only passenger so far was an old market woman who sat
beside the driver talking volubly. The accent of
our friend&rsquo;s hail was worthy of a real Englishman;
the jolting vehicle pulled up, he threw in his bag and
took his seat. There was just time for a wave of the
hand unseen by the other occupants, and a turn in the
road shut him from our sight.</p>

<p>I must confess that it was with a good deal of relief
that I saw Von Lindheim safely on his way. I had my
doubts as to the probabilities of his ultimate escape,
the more so as I mistrusted his nerve at a critical
juncture. Still, something had to be done, he had
the advantage of a good start, and I had arranged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>that if there was no more chance of helping Fräulein
von Winterstein I would follow him, it might be on
the next day. But that was not to be.</p>

<p>I could not quite make up my mind whether it
would be as well to tell Strode the real reason of my
staying on at the inn in the Geierthal. His pluck,
contempt of danger, and promptness of resource were
all that I could wish; he was, I felt sure, staunch
enough; yet I hesitated, and, although more than
once on the point of doing so, said nothing that day
of the imprisoned girl. We had plenty to talk of on
our way back in the recital of the Chancellor&rsquo;s methods
of securing secrecy. However, I did not tell Strode
what the particular affair was that had brought these
men to their death. We made an arrangement to
meet and shoot on the morrow, and I went back alone
to the Geierthal.</p>

<p>On reaching the inn I found the coffee-room
occupied by a young fellow whose appearance was so
curious that I gave him a second glance. He was
poorly dressed, of a very dark complexion, his lip
was fringed with a slight moustache, while a mass of
untidy black hair fell over his collar and stood out
in front from beneath his cap, almost veiling his eyes.
By the side of his plate stood an old concertina. A
tramping musician, I thought; then looked again
and, from habit, became suspicious. However, he
had as much right there as I, so I ordered my dinner,
explaining to the innkeeper that my friend was sleeping
that night at the Englishman&rsquo;s cottage to be
ready for an early shoot in the morning.</p>

<p>Presently the young man took up his concertina
and went out. From the window I saw him seat
himself on the bench in front of the house, roll a
cigarette and lazily smoke it, playing the while softly
on his instrument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A travelling musician?&rdquo; I asked the landlord.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>He gave a shrug. &ldquo;I think so. He says he
came from Carlzig to-day. They sometimes pass this
way, but not often; there is not much to be picked up
here. No people, no pence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought it strange enough to be suspicious; but
when I went out a little later the musician was gone
and I saw him no more.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">I SHOOT WITH THE COUNT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I resumed</span> my watch that night, but all my vigilance
and patience were without result. The Monastery
was as dark and lifeless as ever. There was no more
digging in the wood; for that I was thankful, since
now there seemed a good chance that Asta von
Winterstein was alive. It seemed almost as though
there were some reason for sparing her life, or why
had a false report of her death been spread. But the
whole affair was a puzzle at which I could but vaguely
guess.</p>

<p>Next day, however, adventure began to loom
again before me.</p>

<p>After breakfast I was in my room preparing an
equipment for the day&rsquo;s sport when the inn servant
announced that a gentleman was asking for me below.
I naturally supposed it was Strode, who had come
over instead of waiting at the appointed meeting-place.
What was my surprise on running downstairs
to find myself face to face with Count Furello.</p>

<p>Count Furello in sporting garb, a gun in his hand,
and a dog at his heels. He greeted me effusively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Tyrrell! You! This is unkind of
you to keep me in ignorance of your being within
reach of my hospitality. I hear to-day, by accident,
that an Englishman is staying here. I hasten to
offer my services, and I find&mdash;you! Well, and how
do you like our Geierthal? Is it not picturesque
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>enough for you? I hope your stay will not be as
short as most of your countrymen would make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a flow of polite chatter he followed me into
the coffee-room. I had recovered from the effect
of his unexpected visit and was now on the alert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, too, are for sport to-day,&rdquo; he continued,
having declined my offer of refreshment. &ldquo;You
shall come with me to my preserves. I can promise
you some sport. You can have found but rough
shooting on the common land here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, needless to say, my distrust of this man was
absolutely unmitigated. I knew that his tone and
his professions were utterly false; that the real object
of his call was, in all probability, of a far more sinister
nature than to show hospitality or afford me sport.
Nevertheless, having no fear for myself and an intense
desire to penetrate the mystery of Fräulein
von Winterstein&rsquo;s fate, I rather welcomed the Count&rsquo;s
appearance. It might at least give me a chance of
action, of mere watching to no purpose I had had
enough.</p>

<p>So after a moment&rsquo;s thought I resolved to accept
Furello&rsquo;s invitation, a decision he received with a
satisfaction which was assuredly the only genuine
sentiment he had expressed during the interview.
Under pretence of making a change in my clothes,
I ran up to my room and scribbled a note of excuse
to Strode, which the innkeeper undertook to have conveyed
to him forthwith. I had my reasons for keeping
Strode and Furello apart, at any rate for that day,
and had I mentioned my engagement I thought the
Count would have insisted on his joining us. Also
it will be obvious that there was Von Lindheim&rsquo;s
absence to be accounted for.</p>

<p>I changed my coat, rejoined Furello, and we set out.
As I anticipated, he presently remarked, &ldquo;You have
a companion staying with you. Would he not care
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>to join us?&rdquo; He stopped as though to turn back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is away,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;staying with a friend
some distance from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; We walked on. &ldquo;Your friend is not a
countryman of your own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I returned in a tone of frank confidence;
&ldquo;it is our friend Von Lindheim, of Buyda. He has
been dangerously ill, and we thought a change of air
and scene would set him up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not help thinking that my companion was
turning over in his mind certain plans for neutralizing
the vivifying effect of the Geierthal&rsquo;s air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend returns soon? Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect him to be with me in a day or two,&rdquo; was
my disingenuous answer; pardonable, I hope, under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the meantime I shall hope to supply, however
unworthily, his place of companion to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I seemed to catch a feline look in the face beside
me, and thought that the unworthiness on which he
had insisted so prettily might not be wide of the mark.
We soon reached the private woods of the estate,
and as the Count showed me the way and pointed
out the view of the Monastery I wondered whether
he knew how familiar I already was with it all. For
I had come to be surprised at nothing in that network
of spies and assassins.</p>

<p>Sport was plentiful; black game, ptarmigan,
pheasants and hares fell in dozens before our guns.
A pic-nic luncheon was brought out to us on the
hills, and afterwards, when we had lighted our cigars,
the Count chatted away gaily as though he had nothing
more heinous than the death of a pheasant on
his conscience. He explained how it was that his
intended stay of but one day in the Geierthal had
been prolonged. His sister, who lived at the Monastery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>with him, had been ill, and did not like being
left alone in that out-of-the-way spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You as a bachelor, my dear Herr Tyrrell,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;are perhaps scarcely in a position to realize the
subtle influence which womenkind exercise on our
movements. Had I to choose men for a dangerous, a
critical enterprise, I would take care to reject all those
about whom I might suspect any feminine tie or entanglement.
Most of the successful men who have
made history have been those who either by nature
or experience were able to take love as a mere episode,
an interlude, to be swept off the stage when the
scene was set for the next act of the real drama of
their lives. Pardon me if I speak too strongly.
You English are noted for a nice cultivation of the
domestic virtues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet we have made history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True. But your greatest men would come under
my category. And the very fact that Englishwomen
are so domesticated shows that they have been kept
in their proper place and not allowed to interfere in
their husbands&rsquo; or lovers&rsquo; careers. You are men of
action, and I fancy are often roused to it from a
longing for change from the monotony of the very
virtues on which you pride yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed and did not contradict him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you, my dear friend,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;your
love of movement and adventure is, I venture to say,
untinged by the thought of any woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The green eyes were on me. He was watching
me narrowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; I replied carelessly. &ldquo;The age of
knight-errantry is long past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; The mouth was drawn back and the eyes
glittered with a vicious sneer, at least so it seemed
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo; I rejoined with a laugh. &ldquo;Are we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>not all too full of commercial common sense now-a-days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even for an isolated case here and there, you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not heard of one. Perhaps your experience,
Count, is more interesting than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a shrug. &ldquo;I have seen curious things in
my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well believe you,&rdquo; was my mental comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued in a tone of polite, but, to
me, somewhat repulsive banter, &ldquo;my imagination
could easily construct of you, my young friend, a wandering
knight seeking adventures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least, it is on my own account,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. The motive now-a-days is less illogical
than formerly, if quite as unprofitable. You, now,
might be earning a name for yourself at home in one
of the professions, but you prefer to wander about in
out-of-the-way corners of Europe for what? For
the pleasures of a roving life and the excitement of
not knowing when you wake what the day may
bring forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is preferable, at least, to the humdrum holiday
of the ordinary tourist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holiday!&rdquo; He looked incredulous. &ldquo;Scarcely
a holiday in the sense in which most men understand
the term. You are tied, I presume, by no limit of
time or means; is it not rather the business of your
life now to rove where you will, answerable to no one,
cut off from all ties, your very family in total ignorance
of your whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; I answered unthinkingly, for the
man&rsquo;s manner rather irritated me. &ldquo;We English
hate the idea of dependence and supervision; our
freedom is absolute, in effect as well as in name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had reason before many hours were over to
realize the rashness of that speech. But at the moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>disgust for the hideous methods of a despotic
government were so strong within me that I did not
weigh the possible effect of my words, or see the
trick which had led me to make the admission.</p>

<p>The Count rose. &ldquo;I think, if you are rested, we may
turn our faces homewards now. We have an hour&rsquo;s
walk, and I wager shall flush some game on our way.
I hope, Herr Tyrrell, that you will do me the honour
of joining us at dinner. We dine <i>sans cérémonie</i>
to-night, and in her state of health my sister will be
glad if we all renounce full dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The invitation was, I felt, one which on the score
of my personal safety it was madness to accept.
But my great desire was to get inside the Monastery,
since from without I could do nothing. It was for
that I had spent the day with a man I loathed; to
accept his hospitality was entirely repugnant to me;
but I was fighting against odds to save a human life:
I had to avail myself of every advantage I might get,
and could not be squeamish. The risk, I knew, was
fearful; no greater, though, to me a strong man than
her danger to the imprisoned girl. I had my wits
about me, my revolver in my pocket; I felt that the
path here divided, and I had to choose between that
of duty and that of cowardice. The chance I had
prayed for had come. At the worst it was but another
grave in the wood for a man who had done his
duty.</p>

<p>I accepted.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE DISH OF SWEETMEATS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we drew near the Monastery my worthy host gave
me a short sketch of its history. How it had fallen
from the high position it occupied in mediæval times to
be a Hostel of Mercy for the sick and dying (which,
indeed, thought I, in one sense it is still); then how
the property fell, by the changes and chances of time,
into the hands of the State, from which, for sporting
purposes and a love of the picturesque, he was induced
to rent it. I had my doubts about a good
deal of this plausible story, but accepted the statements
for what they were worth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two or three survivors of the Order of St. Tranquillin,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;still live on the premises.
I had not the heart to turn them adrift, and as they
confine themselves to a distant wing of the building
we see little or nothing of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought of the grave-diggers and their cassocks
and cowls. Pretty monks! A veritable house of
mercy!</p>

<p>On our arrival at the pier, the drawbridge was let
down. I saw that it would have been impossible to
gain a secret entrance that way. We crossed the
great courtyard, the door was thrown open, and at
last I was under the roof of Asta von Winterstein&rsquo;s
prison. If the exterior of the building was gloomy, it
seemed positively gay compared with the interior,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>which was dark, cold, gaunt, and depressing enough
to make a sexton shiver. The great entrance hall, in
spite of the faded tapestry with which it was hung,
was inexpressibly bare and gloomy. What, I
thought, must that poor girl&rsquo;s feelings have been
when she was brought in? My own were such that it
called for a strong effort of will to keep my nerves
steady. The Count led the way to a passage leading
from the hall, he opened a door and ushered me
into a room which was furnished in a style of luxurious
snugness, in cheerful contrast to its approach.
As we entered, a lady rose, whom the Count made
known as his sister. There was not much likeness,
however, between them; still, it was hardly worth
while to doubt the statement.</p>

<p>A handsome woman she must have been once, indeed
was so still, but the lines of the face were hard,
and about the eyes was a suggestion of a sad history.
She looked at me curiously, the expression was but
momentary; then she seemed to resume a mask
which for that instant she had inadvertently let fall,
and chatted pleasantly enough until the Count suggested
our getting ready for dinner. He conducted
me himself across the gloomy hall, thence upstairs to a
well-appointed dressing-room, like the rest of the
house charged with a chilling atmosphere of dreariness.
Left alone, the sense of my great danger came strong
upon me. Knowing what I did of the Count, it was,
I told myself, sheer madness to touch food in his
company. On the other hand I argued that he, or
rather Rallenstein, his master, would think twice
before attempting foul play with me. I might regard
my host&rsquo;s polite attention more as a means of keeping
observation on me and my movements than as a
death-trap. It was hardly conceivable that they
could have even an inkling of my being aware that
Fräulein von Winterstein was alive and under that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>very roof. Anyhow, I was committed to the adventure;
I had an object to gain in going through
with it; and must now trust to fate and to my own
alertness to bring me safely out.</p>

<p>It was my purpose to note as much of the interior
of the Monastery as I could. A glance out of the
window explained the total darkness and silence of the
house as seen from without. It was built in the form
of a hollow parallelogram, round an open space on
which, presumably, the windows of the principal
inhabited rooms looked out. By keeping, then,
the outer line of rooms dark and empty, no watcher
from outside could have any idea of what was going
on within, nor tell whether the place was deserted
or occupied by a large household. The outlook upon
this middle space was no less dismal than the rest of
the building. The masonry was green from age and
neglect, the lower windows were crossed and recrossed
by rusty bars, and the more than usually hideous
gargoyles did not detract from the cheerlessness of the
aspect. I wondered if any one of these barred windows
was that of Asta von Winterstein&rsquo;s prison. If so,
a further scrutiny told me an attempt to rescue her
by anything short of force was practically hopeless.
Still, I resolved to keep my eyes on the alert for anything
chance might have to show me; it had so
favoured me hitherto that I was inclined to hope more
from it. My reflections were interrupted by the
knock of a footman, who came to conduct me downstairs,
an attention which, in my spying mood, I did
not appreciate so much as I did its probable reason.</p>

<p>In what I suppose would be called the drawing-room
the Count and his sister were waiting for me, he
dressed in a dining-suit of dark blue velvet which
rather accentuated his peculiar characteristics.
As dinner was announced I discovered that we were not
three, but four, as a man, whom, if he had been in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>room on my entrance, I had not noticed, came forward
from behind me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, let me present Herr Bleisst, my good friend
and secretary,&rdquo; the Count said with a flourish. The
good friend and secretary bowed low, and as he
straightened himself his face suggested to me that
whatever his merits as a secretary might be, those as
a good friend to any one were at least problematical.
Then I offered my arm to the hostess and we went
in followed by the two men.</p>

<p>If I had any doubts as to a sinister motive behind
the Count&rsquo;s hospitality they were now dispelled in
startling fashion.</p>

<p>As we entered the dining-room the Count and
Bleisst, walking behind us, separated, and for a
moment turned their backs on us as each went towards
his place at the table. My hostess let her handkerchief
fall and we both by, as it were, a common
impulse, stooped to pick it up. At this instant, our
heads being close together, she whispered hurriedly,
&ldquo;Only pretend to eat the sweetmeats&mdash;for your
life.&rdquo; As we rose she was thanking me, and apologizing
for her carelessness, and we took our seats at
the table.</p>

<p>I was inwardly not a little excited by her secret
warning, but flattered myself I showed nothing of it
to the Count&rsquo;s restless, vigilant eye. Before each
of us was a gilt dish of sweetmeats, specimens of the
most perfect dainties of the confectioner&rsquo;s art. At
least, I should be able to eat the other dishes without
fear&mdash;or was this a trick within a trick? I thought
not, but resolved all the same to let my companions
serve as tasters and to touch nothing they refused.</p>

<p>The dinner passed off with less dreariness than
might have been expected, considering all things.
It was not exactly a lively meal, but the Count had a
fund of talk; he was, for such a scoundrel, a man of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>considerable culture, and I even wondered how, amid
the less innocent pursuits to which he was addicted,
he had found time to become as well read, both in
classical literature and the topics of the day, as he
showed himself to be. He was certainly an amusing
talker, and although some of his arguments were supported
by reasoning shallow to the verge of flippancy,
yet they were none the less entertaining, and that
just then was everything. My appetite after a day
in the keen air of the hills was so good that not even
the sight of what I might call the second murderer
of the establishment, that is, the man who had fetched
the priest from Carlzig, could quite spoil it. This
fellow glided in and out of the room occasionally,
and seemed to combine the duties of major-domo
with those of the functionary I have just mentioned.
The two men who waited upon us I had never seen
before, and from their faces I set them down as being
comparatively virtuous, which is not saying much.</p>

<p>Another curious circumstance gave me food for
thought in the midst of my host&rsquo;s showy apothegms.
It was the somewhat remarkable silence of his good
friend and secretary. Herr Bleisst sometimes nodded,
occasionally shrugged, and often smiled, but it was
not until dinner was more than half over that he contributed
anything audible to the conversation.
And even then he seemed to speak by mistake.
The Count was favouring me with his opinion on the
respective advantages of an autocratic and a democratic
government, and supporting his preference
for the former by his usual method of highly coloured
argument. He even went so far as to assert that the
autocratic rule gave greater freedom to the people
than they could get by governing themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, in England,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you think yourselves
absolutely free, is it not so?&rdquo; I bowed assent.
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;a moment&rsquo;s reflection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>should convince you that so far from this being the
case, there is, if I may speak without offence, more
slavery in England than in any other country. Take
one section. What do you call a snob: is not that
merely another name for a slave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is voluntary servitude,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But none the less real
and constraining. Then a stronger case is the liberty
which your boasted freedom gives to one class of
men to make slaves of another; to the strong to
coerce the weak, the rich the poor. You smile!
Surely you will not dispute that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My smile had been called up by the thought of a
power used by the strong against the weak under a
certain despotic government, which put the worst
crimes of plutocracy into the shade. But it did not
seem expedient just then to cite instances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least the weak and the poor are at liberty
to refuse to be enslaved,&rdquo; I answered by way of saying
something. &ldquo;In an autocratically governed country
it is slavery or death, with not always the option of
slavery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Count returned my smile with interest. &ldquo;A
very apt description of your sweating dens in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was that Bleisst spoke, giving an extra
clinch to his patron&rsquo;s argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;does this liberty to refuse
slavery lead? To the workhouse, which is undisguised
servitude, with the prospect of a slave&rsquo;s only ransomer,
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surprise with which I looked at the secretary
was not occasioned altogether by the novelty of the
remark from his lips, but from the impression that
I had heard his voice before. Yes, it was beyond
doubt familiar, and so preoccupied was I by the
coincidence, that I fear I let my ingenious host carry
off the honours of the argument against my country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>I was still puzzling over the identity of Herr Bleisst,
and scrutinizing him as attentively as good manners
allowed, when I was recalled to the exigency of the
situation by the Count&rsquo;s inviting me to try some of the
dish of sweetmeats before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have them sent weekly from Buyda,&rdquo; he said
persuasively; &ldquo;you know our metropolis prides
itself on these fascinating trifles, and will not allow
the superiority of even Vienna or Paris itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My hostess added a word of recommendation and
pushed the dish towards me. Understanding her
feint of pressing them upon me, I took several of the
bon-bons on to my plate, and from time to time made
a pretence of eating one, at the same time being
loud in praise of their excellent flavour. A trick
acquired in my school days of palming coins and
cork pellets stood me now in good stead, and in a short
time the sweets had left my plate and were safely
stowed in my pocket.</p>

<p>The secretary, Bleisst, now began to join freely in
the conversation, and every fresh remark he made confirmed
my conviction that I had talked with him on
some previous occasion, but certainly not under his
present identity.</p>

<p>As his sister rose and left us, the Count came to me,
and, laying his hand familiarly on my shoulder, told
me he could not think of permitting me to turn out
that night and go all the way to the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must sleep here,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I need not
apologize to a man of your nerve for the gloom of our
rooms. We have doubtless both had worse hunting
quarters, and I can furnish you with everything you
need to make you comfortable. So you must not say
no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had all along expected this invitation, and had
made up my mind to go through with the adventure
at all hazards, leaving to chance the details of a vague
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>plan I had formed for discovering Fräulein von Winterstein&rsquo;s
prison. Accordingly I thanked him and accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is friendly of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bleisst,
will you see that all arrangements are made for
Mr. Tyrrell&rsquo;s comfort. I think the Prior&rsquo;s room will
be most pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The secretary had come up to us, and now turned
with a slight bow to go off on his errand. As he did
so, some expression in his face, which I had not noticed
before, gave me in a flash the clue to his identity.
Then I knew who he was. The face was curiously,
unaccountably changed; it was fifteen or twenty
years younger; the man&rsquo;s expression and mode of
speaking were different. Nevertheless, a tell-tale
slip had betrayed him, and now, perfect as his disguise
had been, I recognized in the smug, clean-shaven
Herr Bleisst none other than the <i>soi-disant</i> Professor
Seemarsh.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE PRIOR&rsquo;S ROOM</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Count and I went back to the other room, where
we found his sister playing with a great dog of curious
breed, something between a wolf-hound and a blood-hound.
Coffee was brought in, and the hostess
begged we would smoke there. The dog came to me,
treating my advances, however, rather suspiciously.
I broke up a small cake and threw him morsels,
which he devoured. Then something prompted me
to try him with one of the sweetmeats in my pocket.
Taking an opportunity when my worthy host was not
favouring me with his attention, I threw the brute
one, which, like the scraps of cake, he caught and
swallowed. This, as it turned out, was no bad move
of mine.</p>

<p>Presently I thought it well to appear drowsy and
express a wish to retire. At that moment Bleisst
glided in and announced that my room was ready for
me. I bade good-night to my hostess, who seemed
studiously to avoid meeting my eyes, then left the
room with Bleisst, whom the Count desired to show
me the way and see that I wanted nothing. On
reaching my room I found it furnished with everything
I could need, and was glad when the door was shut
upon my conductor.</p>

<p>So the mystery of Professor Seemarsh was now
cleared up beyond all doubt. After a few minutes&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>review of the evening&rsquo;s events, I set myself to make a
survey of the Prior&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>And a gloomy chamber it was, although made as
cheerful as possible by a profusion of wax candles.
What seemed its ordinary furniture was old, gaunt,
and dilapidated, but this was supplemented by some
articles of a quite modern type. The bed was a great
four-posted one with dark hangings, which added to
the general sombreness. Near the other end of the
room stood a massive square wardrobe of dark oak.
I opened this. It was a somewhat elaborate piece
of furniture, panelled and carved inside as well as out.
A good roomy receptacle for clothes, fitted round with
hooks, all empty save one, from which hung what
seemed an old riding cloak. There was nothing else
remarkable in the room with the exception of several
large pictures which, framed in black wood, hung
high on the walls. One of them particularly attracted
my notice. It was a rather striking full-length portrait
of a young man, in what seemed a student&rsquo;s
dress of the last century. I don&rsquo;t know what there
was remarkable about it, except that it was painted
with strength, and was one of those portraits which,
without having seen the originals, one feels sure must
be spirited likenesses.</p>

<p>He, whoever he was, had evidently been a gay young
fellow, a dandy probably among his compeers; he
had large laughing eyes, which rather contradicted
the sobriety of his attitude, assumed no doubt merely
for the ordeal of the portrait painting.</p>

<p>Having finished my survey of the room, I began to
consider as to the best way of passing the first hours
of the night. I was supposed to be poisoned, or at
least drugged; there was no doubt now that my life
was sought, and my careless admission in the afternoon
that my friends were ignorant of my whereabouts
made my disappearance safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>I wondered if at that moment the Count&rsquo;s familiars
were digging a grave for me in the wood. Probably
the unfortunate priest had had no friendly warning
against the sweetmeats. The reason of mine was a
puzzle about which I had then no time to speculate;
my one thought had to be for action. The peril in
which I stood quite removed any scruples I might
have had with regard to letting anything stand in the
way of my purpose. I looked carefully to my revolver,
saw that the door of the room was fast locked,
and set myself to wait until the night was further
advanced.</p>

<p>It then occurred to me that as I, or any other victim
of the Count&rsquo;s polite hospitality, might reasonably
be expected to lock the door, there should naturally
be some other means of admittance for those who
came in to make away with their damnable work.
Accordingly I took one of the candles and made a
thorough search round the room. There was no sign
of any secret door or sliding panel. I examined the
floor all over, especially under the bed, but to no
purpose. So at last I gave up the search, and fell to
speculating how long it would be before they came
to find me. Would they wait till the morning?
They had certainly not done so in the case of that poor
priest. Anyhow, thought I, they will have a somewhat
astonishing reception when they do come.
Some books had been placed on a shelf for me, two or
three of the newest French novels, and an English
booklet of light essays. I took up this last with the
idea that reading would be more likely to keep my
nerves steady than letting my imagination run on the
chances of the night. So, extinguishing all the
candles but two, I threw myself on the bed and began
to read.</p>

<p>I had turned over a good many pages, when, a little
weary of reading, I let the book fall, and lay on my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>back wondering how best to fight against the drowsiness
which, after a fatiguing day, was stealing over me.</p>

<p>Suddenly the problem was solved by a sight which
put me keenly on the alert.</p>

<p>My eyes happened to be casually fixed on one of the
carved wooden rosettes which extended at intervals
round the frieze of the wall. The particular rosette
in my line of sight was slowly revolving. My first
idea was to regard this as an ocular deception; then,
watching it attentively, I concluded that such was not
the case; the rose was actually turning. It gradually
receded, till it disappeared altogether, leaving
in its place a dark, circular aperture; doubtless a
spy-hole commanding the whole room. Prepared
for this, I had turned over, bringing my head into a
higher position where it would be hidden from the
expected watcher by the fringe of the bed-canopy.
Through a gap in this I could still, unseen, keep the
peep-hole under observation, and could detect, at
least so it seemed, a pair of malignant eyes glaring
from its black recess.</p>

<p>So the time for action was at hand. I turned
sleepily on my pillow, and blew out the lights. That
would put an end to the watching, which was intolerable.
Then I listened. Not a sound. The very
silence showed me that my nerves were in order&mdash;not
even imagination conjured up the slightest movement.
After waiting a few minutes, I quietly slipped out of
bed, and resumed such of my clothes as I had put
off. I took my revolver, matches and a candle, and
made ready to meet the danger I felt was coming.
From what quarter it would appear I was quite
ignorant, and not a little curious; anyhow, I was
not going to stay where it would expect to find me.
I crossed the room, and took my stand beside the
square wardrobe, ready for a dash, and listening intently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>
<p>I had some time to wait, the most exciting suspense,
perhaps, of my life. There I stood in pitch darkness,
straining my ears for the sound I knew must surely
be coming. But when? Whence?</p>

<p>I waited on grimly, revolver in hand, with every
faculty on the alert, for the slightest indication that
the room contained a living being beside myself. At
last it came.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE COUNT&rsquo;S HOSPITALITY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> said that my position was in a recess formed
between the wall and the side of the wardrobe.
Standing here, I suddenly became aware of a slight
sound quite close to me, so slight that had I not been
listening intently in that perfect stillness my ear
would not have detected it. To determine exactly
whence it proceeded puzzled me; any one who has
listened for a sound in intense darkness will understand
my uncertainty. Something was moving&mdash;almost
at my elbow, it seemed; yet nothing that I
could see or touch. Now again! Louder. Something
moving close beside me. Then suddenly the
explanation flashed upon me. The noise came from
the wardrobe. Some one was inside.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I realized this when, even in that
darkness, I was aware of a black object in front of me.
Instinctively I raised my revolver; it knocked slightly
against the wardrobe door, which was swinging slowly
back upon me. So it had been unfastened and
opened from the inside. Whoever had opened it
was already in the room. I waited a few seconds,
then, with revolver ready in one hand, I began quietly
to push the door to with the other. When it was
half-way closed I paused and listened. Some one
was moving about the room in the direction of the bed.
He was going, no doubt, to administer the <i>coup-de-grâce</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>,
or to see whether I was already beyond it.
In another moment he would find the bed unoccupied.
This certainly called for prompt action on my part.
All the same, action was not easy in that pitchy darkness.
I could scarcely move on account of having
to listen constantly for that stealthy presence.
But I guessed the man&rsquo;s first act on discovering I was
not in the bed would be either to strike a light, or to
return as he came to fetch others of the party. In the
former case, I resolved to shoot him on the first
spark of light; in the latter, which I hoped would
happen, I intended to account for him in quieter
fashion. For my only chance of accomplishing my
ultimate purpose lay in wit, not force.</p>

<p>On the other side of the wardrobe stood a table on
which I knew were a pair of massive silver candlesticks.
I felt for one of these, seized it, took out the
candle, and held it ready. For a few moments now
I heard no sound in the room; then I became aware
that, as I expected, the man was coming stealthily
back towards the wardrobe. I slipped the revolver
into my pocket, and grasping the heavy candlestick
with both hands raised it above my head. The
man came nearer, he was now quite close; I could
hear, could feel, his breath. Then, just at the right
moment, I brought down the weapon with all my
force on his head. The blow, by good luck, fell absolutely
true. With an exclamation&mdash;half gasp, half
groan&mdash;the man collapsed at my feet.</p>

<p>So far good. I listened, but heard no indication
that the alarm had been taken. I dared not strike
a light, having regard to the peephole in the wall. I
knelt down and examined, as well as I could by
touch, the prostrate form. He was evidently wearing
the same sort of rough cassock as those worn by
the men who had buried the priest in the wood.
With some difficulty I took this from him and put it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>on myself. The fellow was breathing stertorously;
from the force of my blow there could be little doubt
that his brain had suffered sufficient concussion to
keep him still for some hours to come. So there was
nothing to fear from leaving him as he was.</p>

<p>I now entered the wardrobe and ventured to strike
a match. The light showed me a sliding door formed
by one of the panels at the back, which unnecessary
ornamentation was thus accounted for. I passed
through this, and found myself in a narrow passage.
Pulling the cowl over my head, I struck another light
in order to see which way to turn. On the right a
flight of wooden steps ran up to the roof. As there
was no door or outlet of any sort up there it was evident
that they were intended solely for the purpose
of reaching the spy-hole in the frieze. I went on,
groping my way for a certain distance, then striking
a fresh light to see what was before me. I had two
objects now: to discover, if possible, the prison of
Asta von Winterstein, and to make good my escape
from that house of murder&mdash;neither of them easy.
After moving cautiously along for a considerable
distance I came to a door, at what was evidently the
end of the secret passage. Before this hung the arras
with which the corridor into which it opened was
lined. Luckily the passage, for obvious reasons, was
carpeted with some soft material which deadened
the sound of footsteps. From beyond the door came
men&rsquo;s voices. I crept warily forward and peeped
through the hangings. Across the corridor was a
room of which the door was ajar and whence came
the voices. A plan of action now occurred to me.
Taking the opportunity when one loud-voiced fellow
was speaking, I stole across and hid myself behind
the hangings on the other side. My position now
was close to the door of the room in which the men
were; their talk was plainly to be heard. They were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>speaking of the dog. The sweetmeat had evidently
had its effect, and they seemed considerably mystified
thereby. The Count&rsquo;s tone (for he was there) was
angry and querulous; he was blaming the other men
for carelessness in having left the poison in the animal&rsquo;s
way. This they vehemently denied, and the real
solution of the mystery seemed to occur to none of
them. Under less critical conditions I should have
been amused by this confirmation of the Count&rsquo;s
true character when his veneer of hyper-politeness
was stripped off. His present tone was ludicrously
in contrast to that which he adopted in company.</p>

<p>Presently, to end the recrimination, some one
suggested that Paulus was a long time gone. My
charming host laughed. &ldquo;It takes much to kill an
eel and an Englishman.&rdquo; Nevertheless, as the
minutes passed without sign of their comrade&rsquo;s return,
they proposed to go in a body to see what was
wrong.</p>

<p>This was what I had calculated upon. They came
out of the room, four or five of them, crossed the corridor
and entered the secret passage. I waited till
they should have gone a safe distance, then came out
of my hiding-place, went quickly to the door and
fastened it upon them. Thus I hoped, having the
key of the Prior&rsquo;s room in my pocket, that they were
nicely trapped, although, as it would not take them
long to burst open the door I had just secured, it behoved
me to lose no time in setting about what was to
be done.</p>

<p>Lighting my candle, I found no difficulty in making
my way to the great staircase, to the head of
which, indeed, the corridor ran, and so down to the hall.
The entrance door was barred and locked, but there
was something else for me to think of before escaping;
so, protecting the light with my hand, I hastened
on, looking into every room, trying every door, in my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>hurried search for Asta von Winterstein&rsquo;s prison.
In vain. Every room I could find was deserted;
nor did any show signs of having been occupied by
her. During my search I came across the body of
the great hound, stretched lifeless, or nearly so, on
the stone flagging of an inner hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lucky thought of mine,&rdquo; I muttered; &ldquo;that
fellow prowling about the place would have spoiled
my game, and probably cost me my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the minutes went on my desperate eagerness to
find the prisoner increased. Rushing hither and
thither I plunged into every opening and passage
that presented itself, but seemed now in the great
rambling place to be getting farther away from all
sign of human life. Thinking my search hopeless in
that direction I came back to the great hall, and
determined, sheer madness though it seemed, to
make a quest upstairs.</p>

<p>The utter foolhardiness of this resolve has since
been accounted for in my mind only by the fact that
the excitement of the adventure was now strong
upon me. I felt absolutely in honour bound to
attempt the girl&rsquo;s rescue at all hazards, and by the
conviction that I should never have even such a
chance as this again. So I made a dash upstairs.</p>

<p>I had hardly reached the top when I heard a cry,
then a crash, followed by a shout and a sound of
hurrying footsteps. I blew out my light. It was
too late now. The men had broken out of the passage
and were scouring the place for me. It was certain
death if I did not take what small chance of escape
was left to me. To rescue Asta von Winterstein that
night, even if I had known where to find her, was out
of the question. I set my teeth in grim disappointment
and ran down the stairs again. To escape now
by the front entrance was impossible; a flash of light
told me the men were at the head of the stairs. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>I had in my late search found and carefully noted
the position of the postern door. This was led to by
a short narrow passage opening out of another running
at right angles across the end of the great hall. For
this I made, finding it again without difficulty.</p>

<p>Here I was obliged to strike a light. It showed
me to my dismay that my escape was cut off, the
door was locked and no key to be seen.</p>

<p>I threw down the match and pulled out my revolver.
There, with my back to the door, I could
keep the narrow passage perhaps against odds, or at
least make a good fight for my life. Any moment
now my pursuers might come upon me. They
seemed to be searching about the hall and the rooms
adjacent to it. My discovery was a mere question of
moments. I braced myself for the encounter and
stood in readiness. I should be an easy target there
if the ruffians had fire-arms, but even in that case I
calculated I ought to be able to account for two or
three of them before they could hit me.</p>

<p>At that critical moment, as a faint indication of
light told of my enemies&rsquo; approach, a noise close by
attracted my attention. Some one was outside the
door behind me. Feet could be plainly heard on the
steps; one of the men was evidently coming in. Everything
now hung on moments. If the Count and his
men inside the house should come upon me before the
door opened it would mean that I should be attacked
from behind as well, and my desperate chance of
escape would be absolutely gone. The suspense of
those few seconds brings a shudder even now in the
writing. To my great relief the key grated in the lock,
it turned, the door opened, and, just as a light flashed
into the passage and a man&rsquo;s shout proclaimed he had
discovered me, I sprang from my crouching attitude
behind the door upon the astonished incomer, dealt
him a smashing blow in the face, knocking him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>backwards down the steps into the moat, plunged in
myself and began to swim my hardest, keeping along
in the dark shadow of the walls.</p>

<p>I did not swim far thus, knowing they would pursue
me in the boat, but after going a short distance,
struck across to land. Luckily the night was dark
with a drizzling rain, and it was not until I reached
the bank that a cry told me I was seen. I fully expected
a shot, if not a volley, but none was fired.
Next instant I was in the wood and comparatively
safe. I ran through to the boundary wall, climbed
it, and then stayed to listen for sounds of pursuit.
None were to be heard. After a while I ventured to
make my way by a circuitous path to the inn, which
I reached without becoming aware of any signs of my
late host or his gang. With some difficulty I succeeded
in rousing the landlord, made an excuse for my late
return, threw off my wet clothes, and tumbled into an
honest bed after a very pretty night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>

<p class="ph3">A DISCOVERY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning I sent a boy to the Monastery with a
note.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Count</span>,&mdash;<br />

<p>&ldquo;I regret to have to inform you that I was forced
to leave your roof abruptly at an early hour this morning
in consequence of the unwarrantable intrusion
into my bedroom of a person who came, I fancy,
with no very good intent. May I suggest that your
present domestic arrangements are liable to cause
your known hospitality to be misjudged. I return
herewith the key of my room, having been simple
enough to suppose that locking my door would secure
privacy. Please make my apologies to my hostess
for my unceremonious departure.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>I had scarcely dispatched the note when Strode
came in. &ldquo;Ah! I was just starting to look you up,&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>He nodded and sat down as I ordered some refreshment.
&ldquo;Lucky I just caught you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;or
we might have missed one another in the woods.
I&rsquo;m not one for keeping to the path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was evident from his manner that he had something
to tell me. When we were alone, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky your friend, Von What&rsquo;s-his-name, got off
when he did. There was a fellow after him at my
place last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had thought that not improbable, and asked him
all about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Chap loafed in, said he had lost his way; jaw
enough to make a bagman sick, agreeable though,
but a deuced scoundrelly cut to his jib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have warned you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old fellow, it didn&rsquo;t matter. I totted
him up and set him down, thereafter keeping an eye
on him. Thinks I, my friend, you&rsquo;re on the track of
Von T&rsquo;other-chap, and I&rsquo;ll have some fun with you.
So I made out I was worrying about a friend, a German
friend, who was staying with me and who must
have lost his way. That was just what my swivel-eyed
Johnnie wanted, and he hung on for all he knew,
gassing away enough to blow the windows out.
Well, it struck me that was just what we wanted;
to cross the scent and let our man get away while the
hounds were at fault. So I let the fellow jaw away for
all he was worth while I was all the time thinking out
the best trick to play him. I asked the fellow if he&rsquo;d
have something to drink, slipped out under pretence
of fetching it, gave the office to the boy who helps his
grandmother, the old woman who keeps house for me,
and in a few minutes he brought in a gun and a
message from the Herr, that he was going to stay in
Carlzig that night, and would join me in the morning.
Now as our friend is making tracks in just the opposite
direction from Carlzig that seemed good enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite. You ought to have done him a good turn
there. Strode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope so. Of course I shammed to be much
relieved at hearing he hadn&rsquo;t come to grief, and, as I
expected, my lippy friend suddenly discovered it was
getting late. I put him on his road for Pattenheim,
and then watched. No need to say when he thought
he was out of sight he doubled back and went,
stretched out, for Carlzig. That&rsquo;s all. Thought it
might interest you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good of you, Strode. Now, shall we be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>getting off? And on the way I will tell you my
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were just starting when, somewhat to my surprise,
a reply to my note came from the Count. It
was full of the most profuse apologies, with an explanation
to the effect that an inmate of the Monastery
had been suddenly seized in the night with a fit of
insanity to which he was subject, and it was he who
had so unfortunately disturbed me. The writer
regretted that the expected arrival of a visitor prevented
his waiting upon me at that moment to express
his regrets in person, but he hoped to do so later
in the day. A very pretty piece of humbug; the
surprising part was that the Count should have given
himself the trouble to compose it. But perhaps it
was intended to serve for a diplomatic explanation.</p>

<p>I flung the precious note across to Strode. &ldquo;Come
along,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you what it all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We shouldered our guns and set off towards his
shooting ground. On the way I related the whole
story, more particularly that part which concerned
Asta von Winterstein. When I came to my adventure
of the previous night he was greatly excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! That was a tight corner. I shouldn&rsquo;t
have kept my head as you did. I should have
emptied my revolver among the scoundrels and
then gone under.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chance stood my friend, as it has done all
through,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No doubt the fellow I knocked
into the moat was the man who had been holding
forth to you earlier in the evening, and was just home
from Carlzig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strode laughed. &ldquo;I envy you that drive. I could
have throttled the brute as he sat jawing away at me;
only that was not my line of country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We then discussed the situation, and agreed that
we were bound to do our utmost to help the im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>prisoned
girl. If only we could be sure she was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we two may be able to make more of the
business than one,&rdquo; Strode said. &ldquo;Anyhow, if I&rsquo;m
not intruding, and you want me, I&rsquo;m your man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked him, and before parting that afternoon it
was arranged that he should come over to the Geierthal
after dusk, and we would survey the possibilities
together. So I left him and took my way back alone
through the wooded hills.</p>

<p>Now chance, that had been so faithful to me, was
not to jilt me yet. There was plenty of time before
the hour at which my dinner was ordered; so to
relieve my nerves by not taking matters too seriously,
I strolled along the crest of the hills looking out for
any shots that might come in my way. I brought
off a good many, and after a while began to descend
from the high ground towards the Geierthal, my path
being now one leading eventually almost direct to
the Monastery, that is to say, a good mile below my
inn. With what I determined should be my last shot
I knocked over a hare, but puss struggled up again
and tried to make off. I ran after the animal to put it
out of its pain, and, after some search and twistings,
came up with her, threw down my gun, and catching
up a handy stick gave her the <i>coup-de-grâce</i>. Then
I turned to take up my gun. It was nowhere to be
seen. I had not gone five paces away from it, yet
now, to my utter astonishment, it had mysteriously
disappeared. I could hardly believe my senses, for I
was surely alone in that spot. Anyhow, the gun
was not visible, and I thereupon began to search the
place more closely, not without an uncomfortable
feeling at the apparent mysteriousness of the thing.
The ground was rough and broken. I carefully determined
the spot where the gun must have fallen and
proceeded to examine it methodically. Suddenly
the explanation came to me in uncomfortable fashion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>My foot slipped unaccountably, slipped so far that I
fell. Hastily picking myself up, the cause became
apparent. There was an unnoticed cavity in the
ground. I examined it and was relieved to find my
gun, which had lodged a short way below the surface.
But the hole itself was deep; it was more than a
chance fissure in the earth. It was curious enough
at least to call for further investigation. Clearing
away with considerable trouble the earth and stones I
enlarged the aperture sufficiently to be able to see
what it really was. To my great astonishment I
came presently upon a deep hollow space beneath.
As it was quite dark I threw a stone in and listened.
It struck and seemed to reach the bottom a few feet
down. It was a passage, then.</p>

<p>Resolving to explore it, I worked away to enlarge
the hole so as to afford some means of entrance, also of
getting out again when I should be in. In about
twenty minutes I had broken away enough round
the hole for this purpose, and at once proceeded to let
myself down.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE DARK WAY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> not been mistaken; it was a subterranean
passage that I had come upon. The floor seemed to
be on a considerable incline, and on groping my way a
few yards in the ascending direction I found a short
flight of stone steps. Certain light-admitting fissures
in the earth above enabled me to see that these steps
led to a sort of trap-door formed by a stone flag,
giving exit, no doubt, to the surface above. Had I
but suspected this I might have saved myself half an
hour&rsquo;s hard work; however, it was done now, and I
turned to begin the descent of the passage.</p>

<p>After passing my rough entrance I found myself
faced, as the way ran deeper into the earth, by absolute
darkness. Feeling in my pocket for my matchbox, I
happily came upon the piece of candle which I had
slipped into it the night before when the holder had
served me so effectually for a weapon. This on being
lighted seemed but to intensify the blackness in front
of me, but at least it would keep my feet from pit-falls.</p>

<p>The passage, damp, mouldy, and foul-smelling
from the confined atmosphere, led downwards, and
then having reached a certain depth, its course became
level. On and on I went, the candle burning dimly
in the vitiated air. But the way was clear, and, putting
aside the influence of the dismal surroundings
one could walk on without much discomfort. The
passage seemed never ending, yet the farther it led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>me on, the higher was my curiosity raised to find the
end of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ground began to dip again and a fairly
long descent followed. This again was succeeded
by a level stretch, but here the aspect of the tunnel
changed. The roof and sides were covered with a
slimy green ooze, the air became dank and chill, the
darkness, if possible, more impenetrable. Clusters of
nitre hung in fantastic shapes from the roof; the
sensation of being buried alive was almost overpowering.
But an idea which during my progress had
gradually been taking shape in my head was now
practically confirmed.</p>

<p>The mysterious passage I calculated led direct
towards the Monastery. This was the only conceivable
explanation of its existence. The reason of
the sudden dive and the reeking walls was that it
was now running under the moat. If so, and there
was scarcely room for doubt, it must lead to some part
of the Monastery. This thought spurred me on to
pursue my way through about as abominable a bolt-hole
as man ever devised.</p>

<p>But I was now at the end. The tunnel stopped
abruptly at a winding flight of stone steps. Up these
I climbed, laboriously enough, for no pains had been
wasted on convenience; ascent was just practicable,
and no more. When at length the top was reached I
found my head against a wooden trap-door. I expected
that this would be the end of that afternoon&rsquo;s
exploration, but to my joy I found that it was not
fastened. Very cautiously I pushed it upwards, the
shower of dust which was dislodged being almost welcome
after the damp, noisome air I had been breathing.
I found myself emerging into what seemed a
cellar, anyhow a good-sized room in the basement of
the Monastery. Nothing was to be heard; so far I
was safe enough. I came up out of the stairway and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>set about discovering where it had landed me. I
had judged it expedient to put out my candle, for
only just enough remained to take me back again,
and the light might betray me. So I had to grope
about in semi-darkness. The first thing was to feel
round the walls for an outlet, and presently my touch
told me the door was reached. This yielded to a
push and I passed through. I was now in a passage
at the farther end of which a faint light shone. Very,
very cautiously now I stole along, stopping between
each long, wary step to listen. As I drew near the
light I could see that it came from a doorway which
opened upon the passage. My position seemed risky
in the extreme; gradually I neared the light, scarce
daring to breathe. Nothing was to be heard, anxiously
as I listened.</p>

<p>At last I had crept to the doorway, and, after a
pause, ventured to peep in. Then I saw that the
light came through the barred window of an inner
room. Having made certain of this and that the
outer chamber was empty, I moved across till I
could look through the window.</p>

<p>The first glance showed me a sight which amply
repaid all my toil and danger.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">ASTA AT LAST</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> room into which I looked was furnished in a
style surprisingly in contrast to its situation. The
walls were hung with rich brocaded curtains, the
furniture and ornaments in the apartment were those
of a luxuriously appointed boudoir. There appeared
to be no window in the room save that (and it was
practically none) through which I was spying, but it
was lighted by several delicately-shaded lamps,
which added to its cosy appearance. On a couch a
girl sat reading. I needed not to wait till she looked
up to be certain that it was Asta von Winterstein.
My heart gave a great throb of joy to find that after
all she was alive; but poor girl! thought I, what a
prison, what a fate!</p>

<p>There was hope, however, now that I had found her,
and I longed to be able to communicate my hope to
her. She looked pale, as was natural, but wonderfully
beautiful; there was a dignity about her expression
now which had not been noticeable in the
lively bantering girl I had danced with at Buyda.</p>

<p>My one thought now was how to attract her notice
without jeopardizing the chance which fate had thrown
in my way. Just as I had made up my mind to tap
very softly at the glass between us, the girl suddenly
raised her head and, following her glance, I saw a
movement in the curtain at the further side of the
room. Next moment it was pushed aside and another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>girl entered&mdash;the girl whom I had known as Miss
Seemarsh.</p>

<p>She brought in a tray with tea and dishes of cakes
and confectionery. I thought of the Count&rsquo;s special
bon-bons, and wondered whether Fräulein Asta
was running the same risk. Perhaps not; they evidently
had some object in keeping her alive, or why
was the tragedy not already accomplished? Delay
was certainly not one of the Jaguar&rsquo;s methods. The
girl set down the tray on the table which she placed
by the prisoner&rsquo;s side. They spoke a few words to
each other, and then the girl began to move about
the room, putting things tidy in a desultory sort of
way, and occasionally making a laughing remark to
Asta, who replied wearily. As she went about the
room she took something out of a small dark box.
Then turning round she seated herself carelessly on the
arm of a large chair, and I could see that the object
in her hands was a concertina. She held it up and
played the first few bars of a lively operatic air. Then
I shrewdly guessed her to have been also the pretended
wandering boy musician I had seen at the inn. She
had, no doubt, been sent to spy upon me and Von
Lindheim, and her position in the Count&rsquo;s household
was clear.</p>

<p>Her music evidently worried the other, for she said
something to the girl, who at once left off playing,
replaced the instrument, and shortly afterwards left
the room.</p>

<p>It now seemed that a favourable opportunity had
come of making my presence known to the prisoner.
I tapped softly on the pane. The Fräulein, who had
resumed her listless attitude of reading, raised her
head in surprise and listened. I tapped again. She
looked in my direction now almost in terror. Standing
as I did in comparative darkness she could probably
see nothing of me. I brought my face close to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>the glass, and spoke her name. She must have seen
me then, for she rose, laid down her book, and stood
irresolute for a few seconds, seemingly between fear
and joy. She went quickly to the door, drew aside the
curtain which hung before it, and seemed to satisfy
herself that no one was near. Then she ran towards
me. I shall never forget the look on her face as she
crossed the room. It was radiant. When she saw
me, every trace of apprehension vanished. But the
glass and the bars were between us; her face was as
close to them on one side as mine was on the other.
I put my hands round my mouth. &ldquo;Can you open
the window?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>She heard me, for she examined the window and
then shook her head. It was evidently not intended
to open, the leaded glass having been put in apparently
recently to cover what had been a bare aperture, open
but for the bars. I took out my knife and proceeded
to loosen one of the panes by easing the leaden frame
away from its edges. The girl had made signs that
she would keep watch by the door while my work
was going on; in about five minutes I had the satisfaction
of being able to take out the pane, and then
she came back to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got your fan, Fräulein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You! That night in Buyda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It fell at my feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be thanked! And you have come to save
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I have worked to that end ever since
I read your message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are brave! But you do not know the
dangers of this horrible place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, at least a few of them. But tell
me, Fräulein, are you in immediate danger&mdash;of your
life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked troubled. &ldquo;I cannot tell. I am dead,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>practically to the world. You are the only one,
except these villains here, who know that I am alive.
And so my life, being nothing in the world, hangs by a
thread which any moment may be snipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fräulein, you must not despair. I will save you
or give my life for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried miserably. &ldquo;Why have you
come? I had given up all hope. I was resigned to
my fate. Now the sight of you, of a friend, has made
me feel I cannot die. And yet there is no escape.
These wretches are pitiless, and even if they were not,
what are they but the creatures of him who never
spares? The very air of this vile place is death. I
had heard of the Hostel of St. Tranquillin in my happy
days, but little thought I should spend my last hours
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was weeping in a piteous state of distress. I
strove, in spite of natural misgivings, to comfort her,
bidding her hope for a speedy escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is impossible!&rdquo; she said when I had told
her of the secret way. &ldquo;If we should escape it would
be but for a few hours which would bring us certain
death. And yet to stay here may be worse than
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ran again to the door, listened, and returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why I, who am
mourned as dead, am permitted to live&mdash;if only for a
little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Princess&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you know of that! Yes; that fatal escapade.
We little thought how terrible its consequences were
to be, how swiftly the Jaguar was to strike. He,
Rallenstein, naturally determined on my death, but
was shrewd enough to know that my father is powerful,
so he would strike cunningly. I was to die two deaths,
the first a false one, so that the Chancellor might see
how my relations accepted it; and when he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>have nothing to fear from them, then I, already dead
to the world, was to die in reality, like poor Von
Orsova. That is why I am brought here. Probably
Rallenstein already believes me dead, but this man,
Furello&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I could guess the story now. &ldquo;He is in
love with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded. &ldquo;He will spare my life if I will
marry him. Marry him! Ah, <i>mein Gott!</i> is it not
horrible? This murderer, this unspeakable villain.
Be his wife! And for how long? He dare not let
me live even if he should wish. Already they say
he has killed one wife and is secretly married
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a lady whom he passes off as his sister. She
knows you are here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell. What must her life be, poor
woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy she suspects the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She saved my life last night by a timely warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;And you risked
it for me! You shall not. It is not worth it. I
am a dead woman. You must think of me no more.
It was wicked, it was cruel of me to throw you my
fan. But I was desperate, in deadly fear which is
over now, and I little thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the fan would fall at the feet of one who
would gladly give his life even in the most impossible
attempt to save you,&rdquo; I interrupted vehemently.
&ldquo;Fräulein, I entreat you, do not give yourself up for
lost while there is a beat left in my heart or your own.
Mine is the worthless life, not yours. Let me give it for
you if need be; nay, I must, whether you will or not.
If only time be yet on our side! Let me not waste
it now. What we have to do is to remove these bars
and then the rest should be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>I struck a light and examined the extremities of the
irons which crossed the window. They were simply
secured to the sides by heavy screws; nothing but a
wrench would be needed to remove them. So that was
hopeful enough. I told the prisoner, who had been
on guard at the door, how easy her escape should be.
But there was much to think of and plan before the
attempt could be made. For if it failed her death
would be logically certain.</p>

<p>She saw that. &ldquo;As it is it may be too late,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I am dead already to every one but these
people and you.&rdquo; She made a little despairing grimace;
her natural liveliness still flickered, though
nearly quenched by those gloomy and terrifying
surroundings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very much alive to me, Fräulein,&rdquo; I
returned warmly; &ldquo;and by the help of Providence
shall be so soon to the rest of the world. But premature
action would be fatal. You must make up
your mind to another four-and-twenty hours in this
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I dared hope&mdash;for twenty-four seconds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must call cunning to our aid. To bridge
over the time in safety between now and freedom,
life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Herr Tyrrell, don&rsquo;t make me
hope. It is cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no, if we walk warily. You must temporize
with the Count. Appear inclined to relent.
I can leave that to your wit. Only keep things as
they are till to-morrow evening, when I will return,
not to leave without you. Now, I hate to go, Fräulein,
but the risk to you in staying is too great. Keep a
good heart; above all do not let anyone see that you
have hope, and trust me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me the sweetest little nod of courage and
thanks and stretched her hand through the bars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>As I kissed it I felt I could never let it go. But prudence
reasserted itself, and we parted.</p>

<p>I had little difficulty in finding my way back through
the subterranean passage. The horrors of the place,
its murkiness, the dripping roof and walls, the dank,
unwholesome atmosphere were as nothing to me now.
The vile way led from darkness to light; and by the
time I had traversed it and reached the entrance and
the open air my plans for the morrow&rsquo;s attempt were
formed.</p>

<p class="ph3">AN OMINOUS VISIT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the inn Strode was waiting for me in some impatience,
if not alarm, fearing foul play, from the delay
in my return. After dinner we lit our cigars and
strolled out. Then I told him the whole story, which
indoors I had dared only hint at. I should have
taken him into my confidence anyhow, situated as I
was, and feeling quite certain of his staunchness and
grit; but, beyond that, I had come to the conclusion
that his help would be absolutely necessary in the
next night&rsquo;s most hazardous undertaking. This he
readily promised, as I felt sure he would, and even
with more alacrity than could have been counted on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall simply revel in being your comrade in this
affair, or humble servant, if you like,&rdquo; he said heartily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of hanging and mooning about, taking
pot-shots at birds and vermin, with an occasional
wink at a stupid grinning peasant girl. Ah, my dear
fellow, I&rsquo;ve been in the swim, and know what it is;
slow enough, Heaven knows, at the best; I&rsquo;ve gone
under through my own folly, and if you knew what
the feeling is, the sense of failure and degradation,
you wouldn&rsquo;t wonder that the excitement of a business
like this is like brandy to a knocked-out man. I
was thinking I&rsquo;d have soon to get up a shine on my
own account, but this will suit me far better; we
have the merit of a decent action at our backs and are
not a pair of idiots joining in a scrimmage out of sheer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>devilry. Why, hang it! man, there&rsquo;s a touch of the
old-time chivalry about the racket, with brainwork
thrown in. Yes; I&rsquo;m your man, to see you through
this little frolic, and be thankful for the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked over the plan I had laid and the necessary
preparations. The delay kept me in a disagreeable
state of chafing and suspense, but we both voted it to
be unavoidable. To have any chance of success,
the attempt had to be made by night, and that night
it was impracticable. Our walk had taken us near
the entrance to the tunnel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but now the
way is found, I feel I cannot keep from that poor
girl&rsquo;s prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going through?&rdquo; Strode asked. &ldquo;Will
you let me come with you? I may as well get the
hang of the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the half-formed intention, I had provided
myself with a supply of light. We let ourselves down
into the passage and set forward towards the Monastery,
scarcely purposing, perhaps, to reach the other
end. But we groped on and on, Strode often making
me smile by his characteristic comments and ejaculations.
Neither of us suggested turning back, until
some twenty minutes&rsquo; uneasy progress brought us to
the steps leading to the trap-door. Here we stayed
awhile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are actually within the walls of that cursed
den of iniquity, are we?&rdquo; Strode observed. &ldquo;Look
here! We&rsquo;ve got our revolvers; I&rsquo;m game, if you
are, to carry the place by surprise and hurry these
hellish Johnnies to the warm quarters that are waiting
for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew that was sheer madness, so checked his
ardour. At the same time, however, this dare-devil
ally of mine gave me a very pleasant feeling of confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we return,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have a good mind
to run up and see that all is yet well. It is worth
while as we are so near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strode laughed and nodded sagaciously. &ldquo;All
right, mein Herr. Can&rsquo;t say I see the utility of the
move since you don&rsquo;t fall in with my suggestion, but
then probably utility is not altogether your motive.
I&rsquo;ll wait for you here. Don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was already up the steps, and in a few seconds had
passed through the trap-door. It was pitch dark,
but the way was familiar now, and I found the passage
without difficulty. If I expected to see the light at
the farther end I was disappointed; all was dark. I
groped my way along on tip-toe till the wall against
my hand came to an end at the entrance of the room
into which the prison window looked. All was dark
here too. I crept to the window but could see
nothing, hear nothing. If there had been a light in
the room some indication would have been visible,
even though the curtain were carefully drawn across
the window. No. I was satisfied that the room was
in darkness. And yet it was almost too early for the
prisoner to have retired for the night. The darkness
and silence might mean nothing, and yet they filled
me with a horribly uncomfortable surmise. I stood
for a while in a state of indecision. But I could not
bring myself to turn back in that spirit of uncertainty.
I was committed to the business, my whole heart and
soul were in it now, and the risk was nothing to me.
The idea that I had that afternoon perhaps missed a
chance, even if ever so desperate, of rescuing the
prisoner maddened me. Of course all might be well
and my anxiety groundless, but looking at the situation
as calmly as I could it was impossible, knowing
Furello and his creatures, not to fear.</p>

<p>With no exact purpose except to look about for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>what chance might show me, I made my way from
the room and proceeded to explore the long passage
further. It was an utterly rash and foolish move, but
the impulse was strong upon me, and the very stillness
of the place led me on. I ventured now to strike a
light which showed me a distant door, towards which I
hastened. Contrary to my expectations it was unlocked.
I passed through it quietly; still all was
darkness, and the same oppressive silence. Another
lighted match showed me I was in a large basement
room with a flagged floor, green with disuse. A door
was opposite; I crossed and opened it. Darkness
still. But another match revealed a flight of steps.
I crept up and passed through yet another door.
Then, by the aid of my light, I recognized my whereabouts.
I was in a kind of inner courtyard on which
I had lighted in my search the night before. To find
my way to the great hall was now an easy matter,
though risky enough.</p>

<p>Arrived there, I stood awhile and listened. The
same death-like stillness pervaded the place. What
light from without penetrated through the high, dark
coloured windows was just enough to show me indistinctly
the objects around. I took out my revolver
and crept to the stairs, then suddenly I stopped,
hearing voices. Men&rsquo;s voices, indistinct, and at some
distance. I turned aside, drawing stealthily, yard by
yard, nearer to the sound. I dared not waste time,
fearing what rash thing Strode might do if I stayed too
long. The hangings on the walls helped me now as
they had done before; a man could, with care, move
along behind them without much fear of detection.
A little farther on I seemed quite close to the voices,
and recognized the Count&rsquo;s; but the direction from
which it came puzzled me, until I discovered a
kind of grating or loophole in the door of the room
from which the sound proceeded. I was preparing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>to look through, when suddenly I started, thunder-struck.
The Count&rsquo;s voice had ceased and another
replied, a voice which I knew at once, the most
dreaded in that kingdom&mdash;Rallenstein&rsquo;s. As I recovered
from the momentary shock of something more
than surprise, I looked through the grating. Yes;
there he was, the terrible Chancellor, sitting back in a
great easy chair, at his side a small table with wine and
fruit, and before him Furello, standing with hands
clasped behind him, the fingers, as I noticed, for his
back was towards me, working as with passion or
strong excitement.</p>

<p>If the Count&rsquo;s face (which I could not see) was
ruffled, the Chancellor&rsquo;s was as impassive and inscrutable
as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will hardly persuade me, my dear Count,&rdquo;
he was saying in that smooth masked voice which I
knew so well, &ldquo;that you have blundered through
stupidity. You are no fool&mdash;or you would not be here&mdash;at
all.&rdquo; The sinister significance with which he
spoke the last words was indescribable. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;I tell you frankly, I am far from satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furello drew himself up and spoke more quietly
now. &ldquo;In matters of this sort at least I am not fool
enough to look for explicit instructions. Your Excellency
has been accustomed to convey your wishes
in hints. Acting on them I have done your work
faithfully. There are words better left unsaid, wishes
better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pfui, Count!&rdquo; Rallenstein interrupted with a
wave of the hand. &ldquo;You are trifling. You should
know well enough what my real instructions were.
I told you expressly the girl might be wanted. That
it might be necessary to produce her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time. But the time is past. Surely it
was inconceivable that you really wished her kept
alive. Who could have foreseen what you have just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>told me, the secret marriage of Prince Theodor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all no business of yours,&rdquo; the Chancellor
returned, with a momentary lapse from his usual
bland manner to a sneer that was almost brutal.
&ldquo;When I saved your neck from the gallows-rope, it
was on the understanding that you should yield me
implicit obedience, that the life I gave you was to do
my will. You are not required to think for yourself,
and you had best beware how you take upon yourself
to do so. Let me remind you that that rope with the
ugly knot in it still dangles. Enough! I do not
trouble to concern myself with your motives&mdash;oh, do
not protest&rdquo;&mdash;for the other had made a deprecating
gesture&mdash;&ldquo;I am no fool either, and know men do
not thwart my will for nothing&mdash;for nothing. So!
And the girl is dead. She <i>is</i> dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a searching look, so fierce, so threatening, so
piercing, that I wondered how the Count had nerve to
answer quietly. &ldquo;Three days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! And buried&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the wood, by the grave of Herr Pfarrer Gerrsdorff.
If your Excellency wishes to be satisfied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied, mein Graf,&rdquo; Rallenstein said
sharply, &ldquo;that you have played me a knavish trick;
and I know not yet that it has been with impunity.
Recollect that an unnecessary crime is the worst of
blunders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so unnecessary, Excellency,&rdquo; the Count protested
as the other tossed off a glass of wine as dismissing
the subject. &ldquo;One of my reasons for the haste
by which I regret to have offended you was that our
meddling Englishman has been here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rallenstein nodded. &ldquo;I know it. Now there, my
dear Count&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was significance enough in the aposiopesis to
make me shudder. The Count laughed; he was
evidently beginning to feel easier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We made a good attempt,&rdquo; he replied grimly.
&ldquo;But the fellow wriggled out of our hands somehow.
Bleisst says he must be own brother to the devil himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation, if flattering, had become less
momentous. I had heard enough; and the thought
of Strode urged me to retreat while I could do so with
safety. I slipped back to the inner hall, and thence
found my way to the entrance of the long passage.
As I was hurrying along this, I suddenly came into
collision with some one, and next instant was seized
very prettily by the throat. Luckily the pressure left
just room enough to allow me to get out the word
&ldquo;Strode!&rdquo; when to my double relief the fingers relaxed,
and the Englishman&rsquo;s voice said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A million apologies, my dear fellow, only I had
to make sure. I was coming after you, as the love-scene
appeared to have lasted long enough. Hope I
haven&rsquo;t hurt you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no place for conversation, and it was not
until we were safely through the trap-door that
I stayed to tell what I had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the girl has come to any harm?&rdquo;
Strode inquired as we began to grope our way outwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my fears about it. If this visit of Rallenstein&rsquo;s
has taken the Count by surprise, there is no
telling to what extremities panic may have driven him.
On the other hand, he may simply have hidden her
away more securely. He said she had been murdered
three days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas, we know she was alive this afternoon.
I have hope there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is the most likely thing to have happened.
I&rsquo;d stake my life on hers up to now. Only
there is no time to be lost, if we have to take this
devil&rsquo;s den by assault to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope force won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;It would be simple madness, however justifiable.
Much will depend on the length of Rallenstein&rsquo;s stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; Strode replied confidently.
&ldquo;Put yourself in the old Jaguar&rsquo;s place and ask yourself
how long you&rsquo;d feel inclined to stay in that rural
Chamber of Horrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So discussing the chances of the situation, we at
length reached the entrance, and without further
incident returned to our inn.</p>

<p class="ph3">WE OUTSTRIP OUR FORTUNE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning I packed a small valise and paid the
landlord, telling him we were going on a shooting expedition
to a district some twenty miles off, whence
the time of our return might be uncertain. Then we
set off for Carlzig. Our first business there was to buy
a carriage and a pair of fast horses. This was not an
easy matter, and it was some hours before we found
just what we wanted. But at last we got hold of
two good strong-winded animals and a serviceable
light carriage, somewhat like an old-fashioned <i>calèche</i>,
our pretext being that we intended them for a driving
tour through the country. We then laid in a stock of
provisions, bought another revolver each, with a good
supply of cartridges, and having provided ourselves
with the necessary tools for the removal of the bars,
we were ready. We had an early dinner, and afterwards
drove quietly out of the town. Strode, who
was going to be coachman, had mounted the box,
and I drove inside so as to avoid observation as much
as possible. By an indirect route and at an easy pace
we made our way to a spot we had settled upon,
perhaps a quarter of a mile from the entrance to the
underground passage. Here, in a wild piece of woodland
approached by a rough grass road, the carriage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>could stay with very little chance of attracting attention
even from the Count&rsquo;s spies. We had agreed
that I should go through to the Monastery alone, for if
the prisoner should be in the same room there would
probably, unless we were interrupted, be no difficulty
in my effecting her release single-handed; if, on the
other hand, I could not find her, or any unexpected
difficulty should arise, I was to hurry back for
Strode.</p>

<p>It was now dusk&mdash;almost dark. I put the tools in
my pocket and hastened impatiently to the entrance
of the passage. I had bought a small lantern in Carlzig,
and with this protection for my light was able
to make much quicker progress, especially as the way
was now familiar. I reached the steps and trap-door;
left my lantern at the bottom and passed through.
Then, as I drew near, a horrible fear came upon me
that a few steps would show me the disappointment
to which I might be doomed. I scarcely dared
approach the doorway where my worst fears might in
an instant be confirmed. The momentary weakness
was overcome and I peered out into the passage. To
my intense joy and relief a faint glimmer of light fell
across it at half its length. In a few seconds I was by
the window. Approaching cautiously, I heard no
sound of voices; the curtains were drawn slightly
apart, I peeped through and saw Fräulein Asta sitting
there alone. A tap on the glass brought her joyfully
to the window. In reply to my sign of inquiry she
nodded that all was safe, so without delay I set to
work on the screws that held the bars. They had
evidently been recently put in and yielded readily to
the wrench. One after another the bars were turned
down while the prisoner kept watch by the door. In a
few minutes every obstacle was removed; I beckoned,
and the Fräulein ran to the window and opened
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>"Is all safe?" were my first words.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. &ldquo;I do not think Telka
will return, and the Count&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a little shudder&mdash;&ldquo;is
away. Oh, I have feared!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I too. But we will talk of that presently
when you are safe. Quick, now; bring a chair. So.
Now let me lift you through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her arms were round my neck, and I had little
difficulty in drawing her through the open window.
&ldquo;So far good,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;let me replace the bars to
throw them off the track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delay was risky, but I judged it worth while
to prevent the prisoner&rsquo;s manner of escape from being
too obvious. Pursuit would be certain in any case,
and this precaution might gain us time.</p>

<p>The bars were soon in position. &ldquo;Now, Fräulein,
quick! Let me hold your arm and guide you. The
way is not easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I led her along the dark passage and so to the trap-door.
&ldquo;Once down here I trust we shall be safe,&rdquo; I
said, lifting it. The girl hesitated a moment&mdash;the
descent was not inviting&mdash;then, holding my hand,
crept down. I took up my lantern and went on in
front, for there was no room for us to walk abreast.
The dark, dripping, noisome gallery must have seemed
horrible to the girl, but she kept bravely on at my
heels, I guiding and encouraging her as best I could,
considering how hurried our progress had to be. &ldquo;We
are nearly at the end now,&rdquo; I was able at length to say,
and then we began the ascent which brought us to the
entrance.</p>

<p>Bidding her stay a moment while I reconnoitred, I
scrambled warily up till my head was just enough
above ground to look about. All seemed safe, so
pulling myself out of the hole, I lifted my companion
after me, and we set off for the place where the carriage
was waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>As we came in sight of Strode he waved his hand
joyfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is better than I dared to hope,&rdquo; was his
excited greeting.</p>

<p>The girl gave him a grateful nod and smile&mdash;there
was no time for words as we hurried into the carriage&mdash;the
good fellow sprang up and set his horses going
as fast as he dared down the bumpy lane. In ten
minutes, however, the jolting ceased; we had struck
the high road, along which we began to bolt at a
rare pace.</p>

<p>I now had time to notice that my companion was
evidently feeling the unusual exertions and excitement
she had just gone through. She lay back half-fainting.
I hastily opened a flask of wine; this
revived her. She was a plucky girl, and in a few
minutes had so far recovered as to be able to laugh at
her weakness and begin to chat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in the Monastery again last night,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again! Why did you come?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not keep away. The feeling that you
were in such danger was too strong for me, and I
wanted, in case of accidents, to show Strode the
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps she felt intuitively that there had been a
more strongly impelling reason behind the others.
Anyhow her look was more than grateful as she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was rash of you to venture again. If I had
known you were there I should have been terribly
anxious. For they took me away to a distant part of
the building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rallenstein had come unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo; she cried in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I saw him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr Tyrrell! What fearful risks you run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit, Fräulein, it was foolish, since it was
scarcely fair to you. But at least I heard some interesting
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Prince Theodor cannot marry your Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cannot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For he is secretly married already. So it follows
that these ghastly political murders have all been
unnecessary. There is every reason now why you
should live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But unfortunately you died three days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I died&mdash;three days ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Count Furello told his Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought a moment. &ldquo;Ah, yes, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems to me, Fräulein, that now it is only
the Count you have to fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a little shudder. &ldquo;And that is bad
enough. But at least I would rather a million times
have his hate than his love. Ah, I cannot bear to
think of it, yet I must tell you. About half an hour
after you had gone yesterday the Count came to my
prison room. He told me that to let me live was as
much as his life was worth. His own risk was so
great that only upon one condition would he face it.
Of course you guess the condition; that I would
marry him; otherwise that day must be my last.
&lsquo;Remember,&rsquo; he urged in his smooth hateful voice,
&lsquo;you are already dead in theory. The grave is dug
for you in the wood outside; in ten minutes from
the moment I give the word you will be lying in it.
It is painful for me to have to tell you this, but my
life is precious too; I cannot afford to risk it unless
I have a stake to play for.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pretended to be in great fear and distress,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>which perhaps was not all pretence&mdash;but for your
brave discovery what should I have felt? I begged
for time; I could not die, I was too young for that,
and yet&mdash;how could I love him at once? You see
what a hypocrite I can be. He was rejoiced, when
he saw signs of my yielding, at the success of his appeal.
He went down on his knees and vowed he
would gladly risk his life for one loving look from me,
that he would be my slave&mdash;I need not recapitulate
the hateful scene. Happily it was interrupted, just as
I was beginning to fear I could not stave off his love-making
without arousing his suspicions. The girl
Telka came in; he turned upon her, furious at the
interruption. She said to him under her breath, yet
loud enough in her flurry for me to catch the words,
&lsquo;Rallenstein is here!&rsquo; He turned grey at the news,
and his face changed to the index of the man he really
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well imagine it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It was a critical
moment for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He turned upon me in panic with such a
look in his eyes, a look in which fear, desperation,
irresolution, cruelty, and what he would call love were
all mingled. Ah! it was horrible. Then he took
Telka out of the room, and the suspense of the next
few minutes, when I was left alone, was so fearful that
I almost fainted with terror. At last the door opened
and Telka came back, followed by a wretch named
Bleisst&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. The Count&rsquo;s head villain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you know him you will realize what my feelings
were at the sight. Then, indeed, I was sure that my
last moment had come. My heart almost stopped
with terror; oh, it was awful, the thought of having
to die like that, there in that horrible place, and just
as the hope of life and liberty had come to me. Telka
came close up and spoke to me. I was so sick and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>beside myself with fear that at first I did not comprehend
her words. I cried out in my agony for mercy,
for the Count&mdash;fancy my wishing his presence! The
girl spoke again, entreating more plainly, and I
understood her then. I was to be removed to a hiding-place
in another part of the Monastery, for the Chancellor
was to suppose me dead. No harm would
befall me unless he discovered my whereabouts;
everything would depend upon my keeping quiet and
obeying orders. I mistrusted them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally. No other feeling in that place could
be possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and Bleisst is the very incarnation of
treachery. Still I could only obey. He told me
pleasantly he had orders to shoot me on the spot if I
resisted. So I went with them, Telka leading the
way, Bleisst following me, pistol in hand. I felt
like a condemned prisoner on my way to the scaffold,
but it was not to be as bad as I feared. We went on
for a long while, through dark passages, across vault-like
chambers, till at length we ascended to a room
on an upper floor. Here Bleisst went to the fire-place
and unscrewed one of a row of knobs in the woodwork.
Into the hole thus discovered he inserted a key. On
turning this the jamb of the mantel revolved, disclosing
a narrow aperture just wide enough for a
person to pass through. Telka entered this,
bidding me follow. I went in and found myself
in a small chamber not much larger than this
carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are to stay here till the Chancellor is safely
gone,&rsquo; Telka said. &lsquo;We shall bring you your meals
as usual. It is uncomfortable, but it is necessary,
and you have nothing to fear.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a great deal to fear; my imagination told
me that this might be my living grave. What better
way to get rid of me than to leave me here to starve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>and die? The girl went, warning me that any attempt
to escape would seal my fate. She is an extraordinary
creature, of a nationality unknown even to herself;
the daughter of a spy; she seems to have lived everywhere
and to know everything. I have always
thought she has hated me under her pretence of sympathy.
So the door shut upon me and I was left alone
with my thoughts; you may fancy how anxious and
bitter they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the idea that our plan was rendered futile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I thought of you, and of all your courage,
and the danger you had faced, and how they were to
go for nothing. But there I was, helpless, well-nigh
hopeless again. I would have given anything to have
been able to send you a message, but that was impossible.
Here was a prison within a prison. I stayed
there in darkness for a long while&mdash;hours, it seemed;
at last the muffled sound of the slowly opening door
brought my terrors back to me. It was Telka with a
lantern and some refreshments. The sight of this
rejoiced me as evidence that the fear of starvation
was groundless. I could even eat a morsel and drink
some wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His Excellency is still here,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Directly
he is well on his way you shall be released.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave me one of her cunning smiles and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I passed the night trying to get sleep on some
rugs which had been provided for my bed. In the
morning Telka brought my breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Courage!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;His Excellency is about
to start, and your release will come soon. It is lucky
he did not suspect you were lying here so snug.&rsquo; She
laughed, and left me without another word. But in
about an hour she returned and beckoned me to come
out. Bleisst was waiting, and they conducted me back
to my former prison room. My joy at getting there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>with the hope of escape was so great that I feared
Telka&rsquo;s sharp eyes might notice it. I feigned to be so
upset and ill by the night I had passed that I could
only go to bed. By this I hoped to avoid a visit from
the Count, and certainly I was left to myself all day.
Towards evening Telka came in and told me that the
Count had accompanied Rallenstein from the Geierthal
that morning, but was expected back that night. I
still pretended to be very ill, and could see that the
girl was quite unsuspicious of any idea of escape being
so near at hand. I kept her with me for some time,
then, as the critical hour approached, begged her to
leave me for a good long sleep. Left alone I made
ready for my departure, and the rest you know.
Ah, those terrible days! Can I ever thank my
preserver enough for all you have risked for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In listening to her story I had not noticed that for
some time past a storm had been gathering. It now
burst over us with a violence peculiar to those regions
of mountainous woodland. The words deprecating
her gratitude, which was, however, delightful enough
to me, were drowned in a terrific thunderclap which
burst over us. The rain came down so violently, the
wind swept round us in such gusts, that we became
concerned for Strode&rsquo;s welfare, exposed as he was to
their full fury. But he returned a cheery, &ldquo;All
right! Don&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; to my entreaty that
he would come into shelter. There was one thing,
however, that the plucky fellow could hardly battle
with, and that was the intense darkness that had
enveloped us. Not to be stopped altogether, he
jumped down from his seat, ran to the horses&rsquo; heads and
led them on as well as he could. Our progress was
now necessarily slow, but it was something to keep
moving at all, and Strode was resolved that we should
not stop. We watched anxiously for some indication
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>of a break in the storm, but its fury continued unabated,
indeed it seemed to increase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is madness, Strode!&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Make
the horses fast and come inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not he. The rain would not melt him, he was determined
to get us across the frontier by the morning,
and we were yet miles from the little town where we
had planned to change horses. So we went on for a
while in the full pelting of the storm. Suddenly a
great flash of lightning seemed to sweep the road
just in front of us. The horses reared in terror,
then swerved, and, before Strode could prevent it,
one side of the carriage sank into a ditch at the
roadside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit still!&rdquo; Strode cried. But I had jumped out
to lighten the vehicle. Each taking a horse&rsquo;s head,
we soon had the carriage on the level again. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t go on in this,&rdquo; I expostulated. As I spoke
another great flash showed us a house standing near
the road a few yards farther on. I called Strode&rsquo;s
attention to it, and insisted that we should seek refuge
there till the storm was over; and, as the result
proved, it was lucky I overruled him. Between
us we led the horses up to the building, which
proved to be a deserted and dilapidated wayside
lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least there is perfect shelter here,&rdquo; I said as I
assisted the Fräulein to alight and hurried her into
the tumble-down place.</p>

<p>A ruinous shed stood beside the house and this
afforded some sort of shelter for the horses. We gave
them corn and made them as comfortable as we
could. Then I took some food and a bottle of wine
from the carriage, and ran back to the house. By the
aid of the lantern we were just preparing to make the
best of our wretched quarters when Strode rushed
in with a more perturbed look than I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>thought him capable of. He caught up the lantern
and extinguished it, checking my exclamation
with,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick! Help me to bar the door. They are
after us! Hark! They are outside!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE ATTACK</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I rushed</span> with Strode to the doorway, and for a
moment could discern nothing in the intense darkness.
But just as I was beginning to hope it might
be a false alarm a flash of lightning showed me a
man on horseback in the road some twenty yards
away. It was hardly probable that he saw us in the
same instant; anyhow, we could hear no voice
above the raging of the storm. Without another
moment&rsquo;s delay we set ourselves to close the door,
which hung to its post by a single hinge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; Strode cried suddenly.
&ldquo;The pistols and cartridges are in the carriage.
Without them we are dead men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another instant he had forced the door a little
way open again and dashed out. It was an anxious
twenty seconds for me, but in that time he was back
with our second revolvers and the ammunition bags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take the Fräulein upstairs while
I barricade this as well as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had heard him, and, as I turned, was already
climbing the crazy steps that led to the upper floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is terrible,&rdquo; she said, trying, as I could see, to
master her agitation, &ldquo;if all you have done for me is
to end in failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us hope not,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Strode may be
mistaken. It is hardly conceivable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>My words were cut short by a shout and a loud
beating on the door. I ran to the window of the front
upper room and looked down. The storm was now
gradually passing away; the intense darkness was
relieved sufficiently for me to be able to make out the
forms of several men standing before the house. That
they were Count Furello and his followers there could
be now little doubt. How they had tracked and overtaken
us so quickly was surprising; but there they
were, and we could only be thankful that an accident
had given us a shelter in which to stand at bay. Had
we remained in the carriage a few minutes longer they
would have surrounded us and we should not have
had a chance.</p>

<p>As I drew back from the window I heard the Count&rsquo;s
voice cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out, you foul Englishman, before I fetch
and hang you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This pleasant invitation had scarcely left his lips
when a shot rang out followed by a cry. In the hope
that the leader of the gang had been accounted for, I
sprang to the window only to hear to my disappointment
the same hateful voice giving order to his men to
fall back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Settled one of them, Tyrrell!&rdquo; Strode called up
to me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some rare sport here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was glad to think our enemies were one the fewer,
and I sent a chance shot on my own account after
them to hasten their retreat to a respectful distance.</p>

<p>But I could not remain there leaving Strode the
impossible task of defending all the weak spots in the
lower floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not be afraid to stay in this room alone,
Fräulein,&rdquo; I said, with probably more confidence than
I felt. &ldquo;I must back up Strode downstairs. Between
us there is little doubt we can keep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>these ruffians out and drive them off, but Strode
cannot do it alone. You will trust us and not
fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head with a little shudder. I had,
in the stress of the moment, laid my hand on her
shoulder. Suddenly, before I could turn to leave
her she flung her arms impulsively round my neck
and kissed me twice. &ldquo;Darling! my own darling!&rdquo;
she cried, her voice trembling with excitement and
fear. &ldquo;If you are to die for me you shall know that I
am grateful, that I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her cheek was pressed to mine. I whispered back
my love in her ear, the love I had known, but had not
dared to show. Strode called me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I am to die I have
lived my life in this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We kissed again, as though it were the last kiss on
earth, and I ran down to Strode, my head whirling
with joy. Perhaps to him, who had rather anticipated
the situation, my delay in coming to his call was
not surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look alive,&rdquo; he said reproachfully,
&ldquo;we shall be taken and strung up, or whatever your
friends&rsquo; favourite method may be of getting rid of
people who annoy them. I dropped one of the brutes
and they have drawn off in consequence. Their
obvious line now is to attack us on two or more sides,
flank and rear; our game is to pick them off one by
one till they are not more than two to one. I am
only praying for the chance of a pot-shot at that
scoundrelly Count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the time he was muttering thus to me we were
busily examining the ground floor of the cottage
and noting its vulnerable points. Luckily the place
was small and plainly built. A narrow passage ran
from the front door to the back, having on its one
side simply the outer wall and the staircase, on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>other the two lower rooms. As luck would have it,
the rusty key was in the door of the front room.
This with some little difficulty we were able to lock
on the outside; consequently all fear of an entry
through the front window was obviated. We had
now simply to guard the two entrances and the window
of the back room.</p>

<p>So we stood, back to back, a revolver in each hand,
grimly waiting the enemy&rsquo;s next move. There was
little doubt that an attempt would be made at the
back this time. We could not be certain how many
men were with the Count; the danger was that a
combined rush might be made and a simultaneous
entry effected through door and window. From our
stand in the doorway of the room we should probably
account for at least two of our assailants, but after
that numbers would tell at close quarters and our
chance would not be worth much.</p>

<p>Realizing this, I made a whispered suggestion to
Strode that we should abandon our present position
and hold the staircase against them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we must keep them out as
long as we can. We might hold the upper floor for a
week, but once let these devils get into the place and
the odds would be on their setting fire to it.
They can&rsquo;t do that from outside, thanks to the
rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw at once the likelihood of that danger, and
what an excellent stroke it would be to end Furello&rsquo;s
difficulty. Presently Strode touched me, and I turned,
on the alert.</p>

<p>He only nodded towards the window. Something
was moving; we could only guess what. Strode
covered it with his revolver and waited. Then he
fired. His shot seemed to be the signal for a regular
volley which was poured into the room, but without
touching us in our cover. &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Strode
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>whispered. &ldquo;They are bound to come now. Keep
the passage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, as the words were spoken there was a
rush from both window and door. We blazed away,
each with both weapons, right and left, since anything
like deliberate aim was impossible. Our fire was
returned; then our assailants seemed to fall back,
but we could tell nothing clearly. In the midst of
my excitement I heard Strode ask:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is not much. We can&rsquo;t
hold this; the fun&rsquo;s all right but too risky for the girl.
We must take to the upper regions and chance
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was slipping in fresh cartridges as he spoke.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;bang away, and make a rush for it.
Once up the stairs we are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the hanging smoke in the passage nothing
could be seen. I sent a shot through it and made a
spring for the stairs. Strode was on my heels; our
fire was not returned, and we gained comparative
safety. As we reached the landing we saw Asta
rush back to the room in terror, locking the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right, Fräulein,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;We are both
safe so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At my voice the door was unfastened, and my love
stood before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been nearly
mad with fear. I felt sure all must be over with you
both. It is terrible that you should go through all
this for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asta!&rdquo; I whispered reproachfully. &ldquo;It is
only for you we fear, dearest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strode had evidently heard her. &ldquo;We like it,&rdquo;
he observed with a pre-occupied cheeriness, for he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>was hanging over the rails of the staircase keeping a
sharp look-out. &ldquo;It suits me exactly. If only we
could get you, Fräulein, away snugly, it might go
on till this time to-morrow, eh, Tyrrell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went to him. &ldquo;Your wound, Strode?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, don&rsquo;t bother about it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It
is only a graze on the shoulder. Now, what are these
devils about?&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see them, can
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither could I, so I went back to reconnoitre from
the windows. At the back of the house, in what had
been once the garden, a movement was perceptible.
Men were stirring, but so cautiously that nothing more
was to be made out. I told Strode of this, and he
suggested my sending a shot or two at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t do any harm, with our stock of cartridges,
and you might bring one of the brutes down, the
Count for choice, if that isn&rsquo;t too much to hope
for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I returned to the window and promptly acted on
this advice. My second shot I had reason to think
took effect, for something like a smothered cry reached
my ears. Then the Count&rsquo;s voice gave an order,
upon which, so far as I could see, four men made a
stealthy rush towards the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; I called to Strode. &ldquo;They are
upon us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sprang back to the top of the stairs as I joined
him. For some seconds we heard nothing; then a
slight noise, a foot accidentally striking against some
object, gave warning that the enemy was near.
Strode waited a little, then cautiously leaned forward
and sent down a shot. It was returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blaze away, man! They are on the stairs,&rdquo;
he cried; and we did blaze away into the unseen.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed. Peering round into
the darkness we waited for the next move. Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>we heard men stirring beneath. The slight noise
of stealthy movement went on for some time;
occasionally we could detect a whisper, that was
all. Suddenly there came a glimmer of light, but
it showed us nothing. Instead of dying away as
I expected, it increased, and then we knew what
we feared was about to happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they firing the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A crackle of burning wood gave the answer;
the light increased and spread. The danger now
was critical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand this,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The old place
will burn like matchwood. We must make a rush
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strode muttered something between his teeth&mdash;a
not very flattering comment on Count Furello
and his methods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t to think of her,&rdquo; he said, jerking
his head towards the room with the closed door,
&ldquo;we could sally out and meet these beasts, taking
our chance. But with her we can&rsquo;t. Stay here,
while I go and see what I can do. Nonsense! I&rsquo;m
the man to take the risk, not you.&rdquo; For I had
begun to hold him back and demur.</p>

<p>He threw me off and crept down the stairs. He
stayed looking over the rail for a while, then came
back to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with fair luck I can put
the fire out. There&rsquo;s not much alight, and our
friends seem to have drawn off to see the fun. One
chap is lying dead down there, so what with the
others we&rsquo;ve peppered there can&rsquo;t be many left.
Anyway, if I come across them there will be at
least one fewer, if next moment is my last. I&rsquo;m
no good, so don&rsquo;t bother about me. Think of the
girl; it is our duty to get her out of this at any
cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>So saying, he stole down again. At the bottom
of the staircase he stayed a moment, then, darting
forward, disappeared from my sight. Next I heard
a banging, as though he were trying to beat out
the flames; then two pistol shots in rapid succession,
followed by a laugh of exultation from Strode. Doubtful
whether this should betoken good luck or bad,
I called down to know if he was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much all right!&rdquo; was the cheering answer.
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re safe now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that I ventured to leave my post, and ran
down to him. He was kicking and stamping out
the remains of the nearly extinguished fire. The
old wood-work had been set alight in several places,
and the door was half consumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy the Herr Graf will trouble us
much more to-night,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Pity I missed
him, though. Anyhow I put a bullet through some
tender part of that other scoundrel&rsquo;s anatomy, if
howling goes for anything. I say! Our pot-shots
have gone home much better than we could
have hoped. Strikes me we&rsquo;ve tucked up most of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our luck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began, when, crack! a bullet
whistled between us and went through the partition
wall with a sharp plug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! That was handy!&rdquo; Strode laughed,
as by a common impulse we dropped on our hands
and knees below the line of fire. &ldquo;Look to the
passage,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let them cut us
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I crept to the door and sent a couple of haphazard
shots out into the night. Strode crawled to the
window and fired. Then, detecting no sign of the
enemy, it occurred to me that I ought to keep an
eye on the floor above. Scarcely had the thought
passed through my mind when I heard a cry, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>door of the upstairs room flung open, and Asta
calling me. I rushed up, meeting her on the stairs,
and on into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are climbing to the window,&rdquo; she said, as I
passed.</p>

<p>The room was empty. I ran to the window and
looked out. No one was to be seen; it was now
pitch dark again. In the pauses of the wind I
fancied I could hear a movement in the shrubs between
the house and the road. I did not hesitate
to send a shot in that direction. As the report died
away, a laugh followed and a voice called out with
startling unexpectedness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well aimed, Herr Engländer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Furello. I made no reply, but waited.
Then out of the darkness came the vile voice again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr Tyrrell! Herr Tyrrell!&rdquo; it cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Count!&rdquo; I replied mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Herr Tyrrell,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;My
compliments. You are a clever fellow, for an Englishman.
But you will need to be much cleverer when
next we meet. So look to yourself and make the
most of the few hours of life we leave you. <i>Auf
Wiedersehen!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The metallic voice had rung out so that not a
word escaped me. Then the wind dying fitfully
away let me hear the sound of retreating hoofs,
and I knew that for the time we were safe. I turned
to find Asta standing behind me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Victory! The attack is repulsed and the siege
raised,&rdquo; I cried exultingly.</p>

<p>Her animated face showed that she had caught
something of my confident spirit. But now that
the immediate danger was past she was more reserved,
and my respect bade me be content with
simply the token of love and gratitude that her
eyes gave me. It was not for me to profit by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>moment of exaltation, when life and death trembling
in the balance had hurried an avowal to lips which a
few seconds might have closed for ever.</p>

<p>I half expected to see that Strode had followed
me; as he did not appear I shouted to him, but
to my surprise got no answer. In alarm I ran down,
to find him stretched insensible on the floor where I
had left him.</p>

<p class="ph3">RESTORATION</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> distress and grief at the sight were beyond
description. That the brave fellow who had been
such a tower of strength and to whom we owed
certainly our lives should have fallen in the moment
of victory caused me the keenest grief I had ever
felt. But happily it was not so bad as I feared.
He was alive, his pulse was distinctly beating, so
I rushed upstairs for a light and the brandy. On
returning with Asta we found that poor Strode&rsquo;s
coat and shirt were saturated with blood. The
sight, though alarming enough, gave me hope that
he had merely fainted, and this proved to be the
case. The wound in his shoulder, which he had
in those critical moments laughed off as a mere
graze, was deep if not serious, and had bled profusely.
The man&rsquo;s pluck and grit had been wonderful
to enable him to fight on as he did, laughing and
jesting, under such pain and weakness. In a few
minutes our efforts at restoration were successful,
and I think the most gratifying sight of my
life was that of those brave grey eyes slowly
opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Strode, dear fellow! Why didn&rsquo;t
you say you were hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer he laughed and tried to rise, but the
weakness was too great. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right directly,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>he murmured. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. The
Fräulein&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was busy contriving a bandage for his wound.
&ldquo;We are all quite safe,&rdquo; she said cheerily. &ldquo;You
must keep quiet. Mr. Tyrrell is going to drive now
and you will finish the journey in the carriage with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled. &ldquo;What are the brutes doing? Hope
you hammered them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him how they had been beaten off, and
the news seemed to do him even more good than
the brandy I was giving him.</p>

<p>We washed and dressed his wound to the best
of our skill; then, as haste was everything, I went
out to prepare for our departure. I had taken but
a few steps outside the house when I stumbled over
the body of a man. He was evidently dead, and
from the shortness of his stature I judged him to be
the one who had dug the grave in the wood.</p>

<p>I went on to the shed where we had left our carriage
and horses. As I expected, our pursuers had
done their best to deprive us of the means of flight
by shooting our poor animals. The intention had,
however, been very imperfectly carried out. Both
horses lay on the ground, dead, as I thought, but it
turned out that only one had been killed. The other
on my approach began to kick and struggle. When
released from the harness which kept it down beside
its dead companion it struggled to its feet whinnying
with terror. I did my best to soothe it while looking
for its wound. None was to be seen and I soon
convinced myself that by some lucky accident the
animal was practically unhurt. So far good;
still, one horse would not be of much use on those
rough heavy roads. I wondered whether our pursuers
had left any of their own steeds behind them;
there would assuredly be more than one with no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>rider to carry back to the Geierthal. I ran into
the house, explained the situation, and told
them I was going to hunt about for a second
horse.</p>

<p>I argued that when the party dismounted to advance
and attack us they would naturally have
tied up their horses at the roadside near by, and it
was just probable that thereabouts one might be
found. The common horses of those parts, such as
the Count&rsquo;s men would ride, were hardly valuable
enough for their loss to be any great consideration,
and if Bleisst had really been wounded, his chief
would have enough to do to get him home without
the trouble of trying to lead three or four horses
as well. No doubt they would have been turned
loose, but I might get hold of one for all that. My
conjecture proved correct. I had gone but a short
distance in my search when suddenly there was
the noise of a rush just in front of me, and a great
dark object sprang up into the road. It was an
exciting moment, with the full suspicion of a trap
in my mind. With my revolver ready I stood still
and watched. The horse had trotted off nervously;
he now stopped and gave a low neigh. Feeling
pretty sure that he was alone I went forward cautiously.
It was risky, but as it turned out I was
safe enough. Having been used to horses all my
life I knew how to give this fellow confidence and
get hold of him. Then I led him to the carriage,
put on him the dead one&rsquo;s harness, and all was ready
for a start.</p>

<p>Fräulein Asta was greatly relieved when I returned
with an account of my success, since every
moment we delayed obviously increased our danger.
Happily, poor Strode seemed much easier and was
in quite high spirits. Between us we bore him out
to the carriage, making him as comfortable as pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>sible;
then I led the horses to the road, mounted
the box, and we resumed our journey.</p>

<p>I have often thought since that it would have
been some satisfaction to have found out how many
of the Count&rsquo;s ruffians we really did send to their
account, and no doubt had not my love been with
us I would have risked a ten minutes&rsquo; search to
satisfy myself. As it was we had to be content
with the inference that the leader would not have
abandoned the attack had not the party been well-nigh
annihilated.</p>

<p>The fear of immediate pursuit was now removed,
still no time was to be lost, and I kept my oddly-matched
pair swinging along at the best pace I could
get out of them, resolved that nothing but dire
necessity should cause another halt before we cleared
the frontier. That&mdash;the nearest road out of the
country&mdash;was all we could think of then; it would
be time enough to determine on our after destination
when we were once safe beyond the limit of
the Jaguar&rsquo;s spring.</p>

<p>So we pushed on through the night, on and on till
blackness turned by imperceptible degrees to grey,
dark at first, then lighter and lighter till the red
streaks of dawn at length made the landscape clear.
On and on we rattled, through still sleeping villages,
becoming more wakeful as we and time went on,
past yawning peasants driving forth their primitive
ox-wains and ploughs; on and on, every mile making
our hearts lighter and raising our hopes as it brought
us nearer to the frontier. Strode was bearing the
rough journey better than we could have hoped;
a simple wound to a man in good health and spirits
is not, after all, a very serious matter.</p>

<p>At length, while the morning was yet young,
we came in sight of the town of Bradenfort, which
we knew to be but five or six miles from the frontier.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>Our jaded horses were now at the last stage of fatigue,
and I made up my mind that we must risk a stoppage
to procure fresh ones. After all, that danger was
less than the otherwise inevitable one of a breakdown,
and the time we should lose over the business would
be made up afterwards on the road. Accordingly,
after entering the town in sorry fashion, we pulled
up at a likely inn, where I made an exceedingly
bad bargain for a new pair of horses, leaving the
others as a part&mdash;a very insignificant part&mdash;of the
price. But we were now able to bowl out of the town
in refreshing style, and knew that, bar accidents, we
were safe. In a short hour we were at the frontier,
had safely passed the barrier, and, with intense
relief, found ourselves beyond the jurisdiction of his
grim Excellency the Chancellor Graf Rallenstein;
although, if what I had learned at the Monastery
were true, we had less to fear now from him than
from Count Furello. Still, strong wills do not love
to be successfully thwarted, and even statesmen
who live for their country are not always above
the vindictive passions of meaner men.</p>

<p>We now made more leisurely for the nearest town,
where we could rest and decide on our next move.
Moreover it was high time that we should put Strode
into the hands of a surgeon. By noon we were
comfortably quartered in the best rooms of the
Adler-Hof at Rannsdau; the doctor had pronounced
the loss of blood the greatest inconvenience that
Strode&rsquo;s wound was likely to cause him, and we
could reflect with restful satisfaction upon a good
night&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>The problem now was to communicate with Asta&rsquo;s
parents, and this was a business which in several
ways might be fraught with danger, more particularly
to the Fräulein herself. It was, on the
other hand, clearly my duty to restore her to her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>family with as little delay as possible; but it seemed
for the moment difficult to take any steps in that
direction without again courting the danger she had
just escaped. But the difficulty was solved, and
most happily as it turned out, by a feasible suggestion
made by Asta herself.</p>

<p>We were now within a comparatively short distance
of the Italian frontier. At Verona an aunt of
hers lived. She might find a pleasant asylum
there until her parents had been communicated
with. The idea was a happy one, and a few hours
found us on our way to Verona. Poor Strode we
were obliged to leave behind us, but I was fortunate
enough to hear of an English clergyman in the place,
whom I sought out and to whose good offices I
commended my friend. Not exactly the companion,
perhaps, the devil-may-care Strode would
have chosen, but at least he would have some one
to chatter English with.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Verona we agreed that Asta
should remain for awhile at the hotel while I went
on alone to tell her aunt the great news. I hardly
know why we determined on this course, but it
was well that we did so. For, on being ushered
into the Signora Reballi&rsquo;s drawing-room, I was
brought face to face with two people in deep mourning,
who, to my embarrassment, were made known
to me as General and Madame von Winterstein,
Asta&rsquo;s parents. As I recovered from my surprise
I bowed and said how fortunate I was to meet them,
as I had lately come from Buyda, and the very
reason of my visit was to acquaint the Signora with
certain facts connected with the fate of Fräulein
Asta von Winterstein.</p>

<p>My words had naturally a great and not altogether
happy effect on her parents, and the General
asked me, in some surprise, with a tinge of suspicion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>how I came to know anything about it, and particularly
Signora Reballi&rsquo;s relationship to his daughter.
To fence his question was idle, to blurt out the
truth would have been dangerous, so I asked him to
let me first of all speak a word to him in private.
To this he acceded with an increasing suspicion
and led the way to another room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;that your daughter
was killed in a carriage accident on the Salenberg
road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhappily; although&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The body has not been found. That in itself
should leave room for doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me so strangely that I began to fear
the effect of the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely. &ldquo;Tell
me what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there is no need to abandon hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have reason to doubt?
No! no! In Heaven&rsquo;s name, speak, monsieur.
What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;great doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he seemed to see intuitively what I was
aiming at. By what must have been an intense
effort he restrained his excitement and said quite
quietly, &ldquo;You have come to tell me that my daughter
is alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I smiled, and at my smile he broke down and
turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a long and extraordinary story,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but the end of it is that Fräulein Asta is alive
and in Verona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he half sobbed. &ldquo;Thank God!
I must see her. Let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will bring her to you. But Madame von
Winterstein&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask my wife to come to me here,&rdquo; he said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>the fever of excitement getting stronger hold of
him every moment. &ldquo;She must hear the good
news from my lips. Ah, God be thanked! My
Asta comes back to us from the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did as he wished, then drove off for Asta. In
less than half an hour mother and father were kissing
with tears of joy the daughter whose tragic
fate they had mourned with such bitter sorrow.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE LAST MEETING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days that followed were some of the happiest
of my life. There was, as may be imagined, more
than ordinary delight in having been the instrument
of that marvellous change from sorrow to joy, and
such joy, the like of which it has been few men&rsquo;s luck
to witness. Then came the happiness of my betrothal,
and the sunny days seemed to glide by with scarcely a
cloud on our horizon. And, as though everything
conspired to complete our happiness, one that did seem
in our graver moments to threaten, was suddenly dispersed.
One morning I saw in an Italian newspaper a
paragraph to the effect that the Count von Rallenstein
had on the previous day been seized with a
paralytic stroke, and that the famous Chancellor&rsquo;s state
of health gave occasion for considerable anxiety.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances we could hardly pretend
to take as anything but good fortune the news that
the ruthless, vindictive autocrat&rsquo;s power for harm was
practically at an end. From Von Lindheim, now safe
in Paris, I had received news; the end of the Chancellor&rsquo;s
reign would make all the difference to him;
for, however matters might have otherwise changed
(as by the failure of Rallenstein&rsquo;s marriage scheme),
he would never have dared to risk a return to his
native country under the old régime. I sent the good
news to my friend, with a suggestion that he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>join us at Verona. Strode, now well again, was expected;
naturally Asta&rsquo;s parents were most anxious
to make his acquaintance and thank him personally
for the indispensable part he had taken in the rescue.
We were going to be a very happy and merry party;
but the night before our friend&rsquo;s arrival a startling
event happened which showed me on the brink of what
an awful danger we were trifling.</p>

<p>That night we were invited to a rather grand reception
at the Guacini Palace. Naturally the rooms
were crowded, so crowded that Asta and I made our
way from the crush, and finding a little room leading
out of one of the salons we sat there cosily, out of
touch, yet in sight of the restless crowd just beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a change,&rdquo; Asta remarked, &ldquo;in my hopes,
in my life, from only a few days ago. Think of me
in that dismal room, a prisoner expecting every time
the door opened that death would enter. Could I ever
have dreamt to have seen the world again like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not let your mind run on that gloomy
time now that it is so happily past,&rdquo; I remonstrated,
clasping the hand which was slid into mine. &ldquo;We
have now only joy to look forward to, for it shall not
be my fault if the future does not compensate for all
you have gone through. It is hard, but you must try,
dearest, to dismiss it all as a hideous dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to be so happy,&rdquo; she said lovingly,
&ldquo;that I am sure as time goes on I shall think less of
those terrible days. But can I forget them without
ignoring a certain dear brave Englishman who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stopped her. &ldquo;Asta, I wish you would forget that
part of our acquaintance. I don&rsquo;t want you to love
me for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;For that only, you mean, sir.
But as to forgetting one little incident&mdash;no; not if by
that I might have no recollection of my terror and
sufferings. And now all is life and joy again. A few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>days ago I had nothing before me but the choice of
death&mdash;or worse.&rdquo; She shuddered. &ldquo;Of becoming
the Countess Furello; the wife of a murderer. Can I
ever thank you, ever love you enough? It is so hot
here,&rdquo; she said, after a pause which was not altogether
blank; &ldquo;let us come and see whether we can
find our way to the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we rose I noticed that a jewel in her hair had
become disarranged and was in danger of falling out.
She turned to a great mirror on the wall and made the
ornament fast. Suddenly, as she turned again, she
gave a little half-gasping cry. I thought she must
have hurt her head with the pin of the ornament, but
soon saw that her cry had been called forth by something
much worse than that, for she clasped my hand
convulsively, and for some moments seemed speechless
for very terror. At length she could answer me, in
a frightened whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Furello! I saw him there as I turned from the
glass. His face there, looking in at us. He is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; I echoed incredulously, though with an
uneasy feeling that the thing was quite possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, yes; I saw the hateful face in the doorway, I
tell you. He looked into this room, only for a
moment. Jasper, my darling, you will save me from
him, will you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I reassured her as best I could, both on that point
and on the likelihood of her being mistaken. &ldquo;Your
mind is full of the man,&rdquo; I argued. &ldquo;Some one resembling
him looked in, and your nerves not having
quite recovered made you think it was he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she insisted; she was sure. &ldquo;Do you suppose
I could ever be mistaken in that face?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It was Count Furello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what should he be doing here?&rdquo; I reasoned.
&ldquo;Here in one of the most exclusive gatherings in
Verona. His evil reputation is such that no decent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>countryman of his own would know him. Of that you
may be sure. And to think that Prince Guacini
would admit him across his threshold is absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reason as I would, nothing would shake her conviction
that it had been Furello and none other that
she had seen. It was distressing to me to see the
mortal fear into which the sight, fancied or real, had
thrown my darling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will settle this at once,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Come back
to your father while I search the rooms. If the
Count is here I will find him. But I think it far
more likely I shall light on the double who has
frightened you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clung to me as we made our way through the
crowd to where her parents were sitting. So far no
one in the least like Count Furello came under my
notice, though I kept a sharp look-out on all sides.
I gave General von Winterstein a hint of what had
happened, and with a word of encouragement to Asta
went off on my search.</p>

<p>It was vain. The thorough scrutiny I made in the
rooms and all likely and unlikely places in the palace
showed me no Count Furello or any one resembling him
closely enough to have deceived Asta. One man,
indeed, I pitched upon as being perhaps sufficiently
near to the Count&rsquo;s general appearance to have suggested
that arch villain, especially when seen casually
for a moment. But upon my pointing him out to
Asta she was quite convinced that he was not the man
she had seen, and that it had indeed been
Furello.</p>

<p>The episode, mysterious and disquieting enough,
seemed suddenly to plunge us from an unclouded happiness
and confidence into fear. Not that there was
any danger of open violence there. It was quite
certain that if Furello was really among the guests, a
word to the Prince would be enough to have him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>turned out not only of the palace but probably of the
country. The worst part of it was, though, that the
Count&rsquo;s methods were essentially cunning and secret;
had he been an open enemy there would have been
little ground for fear.</p>

<p>I was inclined, however, to regard the whole affair as
the effect of Asta&rsquo;s unstrung nerves. Rallenstein was
now practically <i>hors de combat</i>, and it was scarcely
likely that the Count would have ventured to follow
us with any sinister purpose on his own account. The
idea in my mind was that he was somewhat of a
coward who required the impelling will of a stronger
man behind his fell enterprises.</p>

<p>For the rest of the time I stayed at the palace I did
not cease to look about for the man; had he been
there I certainly must have lighted upon him. The
report of my fruitless search at last reassured Asta a
little, and when I parted from her at her aunt&rsquo;s house I
was glad to see that she seemed to have got over the
worst of her fear. We had arranged to meet Strode
next day, and I turned towards my hotel full of
pleasant anticipations.</p>

<p>When I arrived there it was past midnight; a sleepy
porter let me in, and I went straight to my apartment,
which consisted of a sitting-room, with a bedroom,
<i>en suite</i>. Here I found a long letter awaiting me from
Von Lindheim. Tired as I was, I lighted the candles
on my table and began to read it, being eager to know
what his plans were. This was the first letter of any
length I had received from him; it was closely written,
and contained an account of the incidents of his long
journey, including some narrow escapes he had had
from being detected and falling into the hands of
Rallenstein&rsquo;s emissaries. I had drawn a chair to the
table and sat down to study the closely-written pages,
when, in turning over one and raising my eyes to the
beginning of the next, they caught on the opposite wall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>an arresting movement, a stirring of the shadow
thrown by a full moon on the opposite wall. My
back was to the window, and the phenomenon betokened
that the drawn curtains behind me were being
stealthily moved apart. Realizing this, I raised the
letter to the level of my eyes, as though it were difficult
to decipher. Looking over the paper, I watched
the wall before me. Slowly the streak widened, and
in the middle there appeared a shadow&mdash;the form,
unmistakably, of a man&rsquo;s head, framed, as it were,
in the aperture.</p>

<p>Then, with a thrill, I knew that a crisis, the most
desperate of all, had come. Assuredly nothing but
sheer presence of mind was between me and death.
This thought nerved me; every moment now was
critical. A suspicious movement on my part would
mean a bullet through me; before I could turn I
should be a dead man. My one chance lay in taking
my concealed enemy by surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tchut! I do wish, my dear friend, you would
write legibly,&rdquo; I said aloud. &ldquo;Was there ever such a
fist! I shall have to get a reading-glass to you, mein
Herr. Let&rsquo;s see, there was one on this table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering thus, always distinctly enough for my
words to be heard, I moved away quickly and crossed
to a little writing-table that stood in the corner of the
room. By this I was somewhat out of that uncomfortable
direct line of fire. The bell was at the other
side of the room; to have attempted to reach it would
have been madness. Making a pretence of seeking the
glass among the nick-nacks on the writing-table I was
able to get out my revolver, which events had now
taught me never to be without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, here it is!&rdquo; I said, going back as to my chair.</p>

<p>Next instant, by a quick movement, I had turned
and flung aside the curtain, my revolver covering the
place where I knew the intruder must be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Count Furello!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Come out and show
yourself, you cowardly villain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not know why my revolver hung fire, for I had
resolved to shoot him on sight. But the moment&rsquo;s
hesitation as I brought the Count&mdash;it was he&mdash;to view,
showed him to me standing against the window with
dropped hands, and none of the expected signs of
attack. I could not shoot, even him, like that; if
only he had made the slightest aggressive movement I
would not have hesitated. As it was I stayed looking
at him. He stood there quite motionless, his arms by
his side, and, so far as I could see, with no weapon in
his hand. His face looked absolutely white, the mouth
was drawn behind the bristling moustache into the
suggestion of an ugly grin, not reflected in the eyes,
which glittered with repressed viciousness.</p>

<p>I think we must have stared at one another for
some seconds before I spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Count?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grin deepened. &ldquo;A scarcely necessary question.
You are going to shoot. Please don&rsquo;t delay.
I am ready to pay the penalty of my rashness and your
superior&mdash;luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hatred with which he spoke the last words was
indescribable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to pay the penalty,&rdquo; I said, trying
to bring myself to press the trigger. His face was
calm now except for the gleam of desperation in his
eyes. My better judgment told me to send a bullet
through that scoundrel&rsquo;s heart, yet I paused, perhaps
in the very certainty that the heart was covered by my
pistol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are rivals, it seems,&rdquo; Furello said calmly.
&ldquo;May we not settle our differences in the approved
fashion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rivals! you and I!&rdquo; was my scornful answer.
&ldquo;Was that your intention, Count?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>He gave a shrug and a look of devilish mockery.
&ldquo;I had not made up my mind. I have not an Englishman&rsquo;s
good fortune. But it is plain that the time for
one of us has arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In talking to me like this he must have felt pretty
confident of the difference between my nature and his
own; had the positions been reversed, little time
would he have given me for parley, except, perhaps, as
a cat prolongs a mouse&rsquo;s agony. I had evidently
taken him by surprise, and so at a disadvantage; no
chance was left for him but to calculate upon my
sense of chivalry. Chivalry with that murderous
reptile! I wonder how I allowed such a consideration
to influence me; but somehow it seemed hard to pull
the trigger in cold blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give me a chance, my dear Tyrrell?&rdquo; he
demanded again, but without the ugly grin. &ldquo;Or
are you going to shoot me here as I stand defenceless?
If so, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be quick about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of taking him at his word, I, like a fool,
began to retort. The thought of Asta and all this
loathsome brute had made her suffer came to my mind
with the recollection of the pitiable state of fear she
had shown that evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chance!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;What chance did you mean
to give me when you pressed me to eat poisoned sweetmeats
at your cursed table? What chance was I to
have in that assassin&rsquo;s room you gave me to sleep in?
What chance did you give that poor priest whom you
decoyed to your devil&rsquo;s den&mdash;the man who, three hours
after, was lying in his grave in the wood. You talk
to me of&mdash;ah! you&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had suddenly stooped and made a desperate
rush at me. Perhaps he saw that I was working
myself up to do what I should have done long before.
No doubt my vehemence had relaxed my alertness.
His move was a clever one, for in his stooping position,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>he offered a much worse mark for a shot, and greatly
reduced the certainty of a mortal wound. In that one
fierce crouching spring he was upon me and at close
quarters, while my advantage was almost gone. I
must have fired, but have no recollection of the shot.
I only know that each seized the other&rsquo;s right wrist
with the left hand. So he was safe from my revolver,
and I from something I could see shining in his grasp.</p>

<p>I think the feeling uppermost in my mind at that
supreme moment was one of bitter disgust at my own
folly; but, after the first pang of discomfiture there
was no room for any thought but of mastering the
human hyena that had fastened on me. It was
evident to me that I was the stronger and more athletic
man, but then my adversary had the strength of
desperation; he had gained the first advantage, and
would naturally fight like a demon.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a violent struggle at first. We stood
for a while wrestling warily, confining our efforts
almost entirely to the arms. I can see now Furello&rsquo;s
horrible face close to mine; it was as though in those
critical moments every evil passion of his life, every
crime, every knavery, sprang its index into his countenance.
If ever the Devil looked out of a man&rsquo;s eyes,
there he was in that glare of desperate vicious hatred
and rage. Soon I put forth a greater effort, and to my
relief it confirmed the idea that my adversary&rsquo;s strength
was less than my own. I forced him backwards step
by step till I held him against the wall. Suddenly he
pressed himself close against me, struggling furiously
to force towards me the hand I held. In it was an
object which scarcely suggested a weapon. A short
metal instrument, square at the butt and tapering to a
very fine point. I could not tell what it actually was,
but the fact of the Count&rsquo;s using it was enough to give
me a shrewd idea of its purpose. At any rate I thought
I would make trial of its effectiveness on its owner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>So, holding away from the sting-like point, I forced
Furello round from the wall, then against the table,
then backwards upon it, where naturally he was at
my mercy. Then I set myself to force down the hand
with its mysterious weapon upon him. As he realized
my intention he, even at the disadvantage of that
almost helpless position, struggled with such convulsive
fury that for a time he baffled my purpose.
Then gradually my greater strength told, the point
was forced down till it entered his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;&mdash;h!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a cry, as the stylet dug into the flesh. The
grip on my revolver hand relaxed so that with a sharp
wrench I could release it. The fingers of the Count&rsquo;s
other hand still rigidly clutched the strange weapon.
I had now the pistol free and pressed to his temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll blow your brains
out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Shoot! I defy you,
cursed Englishman! You dare not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his head and tried furiously to bite my
hand. I beat his head back with the revolver and
drove by sheer weight the stylet into his neck. He
screamed and wriggled like a wounded animal, but I
had no pity for him, only heartily wishing the part I
was forced to play had fallen to another man&rsquo;s lot.
As I held him there an idea crossed my mind and
determined me to get from him the murderous little
weapon which he held so tenaciously. After a sharp
struggle I succeeded in unloosening the nervous fingers,
and, obtaining possession of the instrument, flung it to
the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>The Count now lay absolutely still, except for his
heaving chest. Suspicious of his further power for
mischief I began to feel for any weapon he might have
about him. There was a revolver in a pocket of his
coat. I took it out, and then drew a little away,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>contenting myself with watching keenly for any suspicious
movement.</p>

<p>He lay quite passive on the table just as I had forced
him down: on his back with his legs dangling, his feet
scarcely touching the floor. It seemed as though all
the fight was beaten out of him. The situation was a
hideous one for me, and I began to speculate how long
it would last and how it would end, when suddenly a
convulsive shudder seemed to run through the man as
he lay before me. His hands opened and clenched
thrice, then another convulsion shook him and he called
me by name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot me!&rdquo; he gasped in a voice thick and
hardly recognizable. &ldquo;If you are a man send a bullet
through me and put me out of my agony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conjecture in my mind now became a certainty;
I returned no answer; simply waited in silence.</p>

<p>Another spasm seemed to madden him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot me! Shoot me, curse you!&rdquo; he cried,
breaking out into a string of hideous imprecations.</p>

<p>I said nothing, and sat quite still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyrrell!&rdquo; he screamed; and then, by what
seemed a terrible effort, sat upright.</p>

<p>I sprang from my chair in horror. The face,
which had been hidden from me as he lay, was now
dark purple, almost black. The blazing eyes protruded
from their sockets, the swollen lips, jet black
were drawn back into a frightful grin; the man was a
human being no longer; it seemed as though he were
already a devil, as hideous as the imagination of man
ever conceived. The sight brought back to me poor
Szalay&rsquo;s appearance in his death agony, but the effect
of the poison here was indescribably more fearful.</p>

<p>For the first time in that perilous half-hour I felt
fear&mdash;sickening fear. The thing opposite to me was
so unutterably loathsome that the very idea of his
breath reaching me was horrible. I recall that in sheer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>panic, I raised my revolver, but before I could fire, the
Count, with a sound of words which the tumid tongue
would not utter, fell back. I could endure the terrible
sight no longer, but rushed from the room, locking
the door behind me. When I had roused the hotel
people and the door was opened again, Count Furello
lay still on the table&mdash;dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So perished this villain by the horrible means he had
prepared for me. When I think of that hideous death,
the idea of my narrow escape sends a shiver through
me. When we came to examine the lethal instrument
which inflicted it, we found it to be a hollow stiletto
with a collapsible handle, this forming a receptacle for
the virulent poison with which it was charged. A
slight prick, as it must have been in the case of poor
Szalay, would be enough to cause death, and the
venom acted so rapidly that a remedy was out of the
question. A very pretty and effective implement of
the great Chancellor&rsquo;s vaunted statecraft!</p>

<p>It appeared that the Count had taken a room on the
same floor, whence it had been easy for him to slip
into mine and await my return. But Von Lindheim&rsquo;s
letter saved me.</p>

<p>There was, of course, an inquiry into the facts of that
strange and appalling tragedy. Happily for me, all
the circumstances confirmed my straightforward story,
which was further corroborated by the dead man&rsquo;s
antecedents. It appeared that before he quitted Italy
several mysterious deaths of the same character as
this one had occurred, with which he had seemed
closely connected; but nothing beyond strong suspicion
had been fastened upon him.</p>

<p>But at last the terribly appropriate retribution
had overtaken him; and surely no man had ever
greater cause than I to be thankful for the gift of a
strong arm and an athletic frame.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>
<p>With that night the story of my series of adventures
ends. I had certainly had my fill of them, and ever
since then my appetite for that sort of thing has been
considerably less keen. But apart from the more
selfish advantage I derived, the winning of a most
charming wife, it has always been a satisfaction to me
to reflect that what I did served a useful purpose in
ridding the world of a gang of precious villains. I
have since visited the Monastery of St. Tranquillin in
the Geierthal; it is now the innocent abode of a prosperous
farmer, who occasionally entertains stray
sportsmen in rather different fashion from his predecessors,
and is, happily, ignorant of what lies beneath
the ground he plods over, or the dark history of
the rooms in which his children play.</p>

<p>After the death of Count Rallenstein the rule of the
Jaguar was known no more, and Von Lindheim, after
spending several months with us in England, was able
to return to his estate, there to live in peace and safety.</p>

<p>From the subsequent marriage of the poor Princess
Casilde there sprang, as every student of European
affairs knows, the consort of one of the most illustrious
rulers; but the keenest and most diligent of students
has never found the name Von Orsova in her family
tree, and yet that was undoubtedly the Princess&rsquo;s
name before her marriage. Still, I have made a
journey, more than once, to lay a wreath on the grave
of the handsome Rittmeister von Orsova, the man
whose fate, though it brought terror and death to
others, yet gave supreme happiness to me.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
